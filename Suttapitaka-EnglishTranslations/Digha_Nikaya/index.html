<div class="fmhT"><i class="calibre7"><b class="calibre8">Foreword</b></i></div>
<div class="fmtx">It is with much pleasure that I write this brief foreword to Mr Walshe’s translation of the <i class="calibre9">Dīgha Nikāya.</i> The translator is a devout Buddhist whose Pali scholarship is backed up by personal practice of meditation. His translation work is therefore a most important contribution to the study of Buddhism.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Mr Walshe has been active in the Buddhist world of Great Britain for many years. Long before I came to Britain, his name was known to me through his essays in ‘The Wheel’ series of the Buddhist Publication Society of Sri Lanka. In 1977 my venerable teacher, Tan Ajahn Chah Subhatto and I arrived in London at the invitation of the English Sangha Trust of which Mr Walshe was one of the Trustees. This Trust had been established in 1956 in order to bring about a Western Sangha in Britain, and towards this end, Mr Walshe has consistently worked for nearly thirty years. At one time he combined this with the post of Vice-President of the Buddhist Society of Great Britain, his career at the Institute of Germanic Studies in London University (of which his translations of the sermons of Meister Eckhart are a testimonial), as well as studying Pali in his spare time.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Even though Pali scholars have produced quite accurate literal translations of the Pali Canon, one often feels the lack of profound insight into these remarkable scriptures. The Suttas need to be studied, reflected on, and practised in order to realise their true meaning. They are ‘Dhamma discourses’, or contemplations on the ‘way things are’. They are not meant to be ‘sacred scriptures’ which tell us what to believe. One should read them, listen to them, think about them, contemplate them, and investigate the present reality, the present experience with  them. Then, and only then, can one insightfully know the Truth beyond words.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">In this new translation of the long discourses Mr Walshe has kindly offered us another opportunity to read and reflect on the Buddha’s teachings.</div>
<div class="calibre3">&nbsp;<br class="calibre3" /></div><div class="fmtx">May all those who read them, benefit and develop in their practice of the Dhamma.</div>
<div class="fmtx">May all beings be freed from all suffering.</div>
<div class="fmtx">May all beings be enlightened.</div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-346">
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-2407" class="calibre2"></a></p>
<div class="fmhT"><i class="calibre7"><b class="calibre8">Preface</b></i></div>
<div class="fmtx">The two main reasons for making this translation of some of the oldest Buddhist scriptures are: (1) The spread of Buddhism as a serious way of life in the Western world, and of even more widespread serious interest in it as a subject worthy of close study, and (2) the fact that English is now effectively the world language, the most widespread linguistic vehicle for all forms of communication. True, the Pali scriptures have already been translated in almost their entirety into English, mainly through the devoted efforts of the Pali Text Society, which has now entered into the second century of its activity. But existing translations are now dated stylistically as well as containing many errors and a modern version has therefore become necessary.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">First, and foremost, the entire merit for this translation belongs to the Venerable Balangoda Ānandamaitreya Mahā Nāyaka Thera, Aggamahāpaṇḍita (though he has, of course, no need of such <i class="calibre9">puñña)</i> for having convinced me that I could, and therefore of course should, undertake this task. To me there remains merely the demerit of its many imperfections. Working on it has provided me with much joy, solace and illumination.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">My particular thanks for help and encouragement are due, besides the illustrious and (in all senses) venerable gentleman just mentioned, to the Ven. Dr H. Saddhātissa, a friend of many years’ standing from whom I have learnt so much, the Ven. Nyāṇaponika who inspired an earlier, more modest venture in translation, the Ven. Dr W. Rahula who guided my early, faltering steps in Pali, as well as the Ven. P. Vipassi and Messrs K.R. Norman and L.S. Cousins, whose collective brains I have  picked on knotty points. It is fitting also to pay tribute here to the Ven. Achaan Cha (Bodhiñāṇa Thera) and his illustrious pupil Achaan Sumedho, whose efforts in establishing a flourishing branch of the Sangha in Britain have made such translation work all the more necessary; and &mdash; others please note! &mdash; much remains to be done in this field.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">My principles of translation are briefly discussed in the Introduction. I am aware of a few trifling inconsistencies as well as a few repetitions in the notes. The former will, I think, cause no inconvenience: they were hard to avoid altogether in this, quite possibly the last, translation these scriptures will receive without benefit of electronic gadgetry. And as for the repetitions, these can perhaps be overlooked in connection with a text which is itself so repetitious.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">My sincere thanks are due to Wisdom Publications for producing this book so splendidly, and to the Buddhist Society of Great Britain for a generous donation towards costs.</div>

<div class="fmhT"><i class="calibre7"><b class="calibre8">Technical Notes</b></i></div>
<div class="fmtx">This book is in three parts: Division One, containing Suttas 1-13; Division Two, containing Suttas 14-23; Division Three, containing Suttas 24 &mdash; 34.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">The Suttas are divided into verses and, in some cases, into sections as well. The verse and section numbers are based on Rhys Davids’s system. Thus, Sutta 16, verse 2.25 denotes Sutta 16, chapter or section 2, verse 25. For the sake of brevity this appears in the notes as DN 16.2.25 and in the index as 16.2.25.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">The numbers at the top of the page, for example i 123, refer to the volume and page number of the Pali Text Society’s edition in Pali. Thus, i 123 refers to volume one, page 123 of the <i class="calibre9">Dῑgha Nikāya.</i> The numbers in square brackets in the actual text also refer to these page numbers.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">In this edition any passage can easily be looked up by either method.</div>

<h1 class="fmh1">
PRONUNCIATION GUIDE</h1>
<div class="fmtx">Pali texts printed in the West use a standard system of Roman spelling, with a few minor variations. Virtually the same system, with the addition of one or two extra letters, is used for Sanskrit. The Pali alphabet, like that of Sanskrit, is set out in a more logical order than the Roman</div>
<div class="fmtx1">The vowels have their ‘continental’ values:</div>
<div class="fmtx1">ā ī ū as in ‘father’, ‘machine’, ‘rude’.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">a i u as the corresponding short sounds.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">e and o are always long as (approximately) in ‘eh’ and ‘home’, but without the southern English diphthongal glide.  Before two consonants e and o are also short.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">ṁ (also printed ṃ and in some older works η) is not really a vowel but a mark of nasalisation (probably originally rather as in French). Today it is read as ng in ‘sing’ (=ṅ).</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Some consonants cause difficulty for the Western student. The difference between the consonants in the first (velar) row is this:</div>
<div class="fmtx1">kh is like the normal English k in ‘king’, which we usually pronounce with a distinct puff of breath after it.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">k is the same but without this puff of breath as in French ‘kilo’. After s this pronunciation occurs in English too: compare ‘kin’ and ‘skin’. In ‘skin’ the k is not the same as in ‘kin’.</div>
<div class="fmtx"><i class="calibre9">The Pali Alphabet</i></div>
<div class="centerAligned"><img src="images/000014.gif" alt="003" class="imgepub" /></div>
<div class="fmtx1">g and gh differ in precisely the same way as k and kh, but it is difficult for English speakers to make this distinction.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">ṅ is the corresponding nasal, that is, ng in ‘sing’.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">The same distinctions are made between the five columns for the palatal, retroflex, dental and labial rows. Thus c is almost like the English ch in ‘church’, or more exactly as in ‘discharge’.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">In the retroflex row (sometimes called ‘cerebral’) the tip of the tongue is turned back, whereas in the dental row it touches the upper front teeth. Most English speakers pronounce t and d somewhere between the two and can scarcely hear the difference between these two series.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Of the remaining consonants, y and s are always as in ‘yes’, ḷ is to ḷ as ṭ is to t, and v is pronounced as English ‘v’ or ‘w’.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Double consonants are pronounced double as in Italian: thus  <i class="calibre9">mettā</i> is rather like ‘met tar’. Note that kh, gh etc. are unitary  consonants which only appear double in transcription. Each is represented by one letter in Oriental alphabets.</div>
<h2 class="fmh1">
<i class="calibre10">The Relationship Between Sanskrit and Pali</i> </h2>
<div class="fmtx">It is helpful to have some knowledge of the relationship between Pali and Sanskrit. Pali, as explained in the Introduction on page 48, is a kind of simplified Sanskrit.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Sanskrit in transcription has some extra consonants: r (rarely r), ḷ, ś, ṣ.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">ṛ was originally syllabic r as in ‘Brno’, but is now usually pronounced <i class="calibre9">ri</i>.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">ḷ was originally syllabic 1 as in ‘Plzen’ (or, almost, the second 1 in ‘little’), but is now usually pronounced <i class="calibre9">li</i>. Note: Sanskrit ḷ is not the same as Pali ḷ, but both are so rare that there is no confusion.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">ś is a thin sh sound as in ‘shin’.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">ṣ is a thick sh sound as might be heard in ‘push’ (exaggerating the difference from that in ‘shin’).</div>
<div class="fmtx1">In Pali r appears as a vowel, usually the same vowel as occurs near it: Sanskrit <i class="calibre9">kṛta</i> (done) &gt; Pali <i class="calibre9">kata;</i> Sanskrit <i class="calibre9">ṛju</i> (straight) &gt; Pali <i class="calibre9">uju</i>.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Both ś and ṣ appear in Pali as s, but are then subject to the usual rule of s + consonant: Sanskrit s + consonant becomes (the same) consonant + h: thus sp&gt;ph, st&gt;th, etc.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">The above rules combine in the case of one key-word: Sanskrit <i class="calibre9">tṛṣṇā</i> (thirst, craving) &gt; Pali <i class="calibre9">taṇhā.</i> Here r&gt;a, s&gt;s, and then sn&gt;nh.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Sanskrit consonant clusters are simplified, producing one single or double consonant: Sanskrit <i class="calibre9">agni</i> (fire) &gt; Pali <i class="calibre9">aggi;</i>  Sanskrit svarga (heaven) &gt; Pali <i class="calibre9">sagga;</i> Sanskrit <i class="calibre9">mārga</i> (path) &gt; Pali <i class="calibre9">magga;</i> Sanskrit <i class="calibre9">ātman</i> (self) &gt; Pali <i class="calibre9">attā;</i> Sanskrit <i class="calibre9">saṃjñā</i>  (perception) Pali <i class="calibre9">saññā;</i> Sanskrit <i class="calibre9">sparsa</i> (contact) &gt; Pali <i class="calibre9">phassa;</i>  Sanskrit <i class="calibre9">alpa</i> (little) &gt; Pali <i class="calibre9">appa</i> etc. Instead of <i class="calibre9">vv</i> we find <i class="calibre9">bb,</i>  and instead of <i class="calibre9">dy</i>, <i class="calibre9">dhy</i> we find <i class="calibre9">jj,</i> jh: Sanskrit <i class="calibre9">nirvāṇa</i> &gt; Pali  <i class="calibre9">nibbāna;</i> Sanskrit <i class="calibre9">adya</i> (today) &gt; Pali <i class="calibre9">ajja</i>; Sanskrit <i class="calibre9">dhyāna</i>  (absorption) &gt; Pali <i class="calibre9">jhāna.</i></div>
<div class="fmtx1">It follows that while the form of a Sanskrit word cannot be predicted from its Pali equivalent, the Pali form can usually be  predicted from the Sanskrit, provided the word occurs. The meanings of Sanskrit and Pali words are also not quite always the same.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">As regards grammatical simplification, it need perhaps only be mentioned here that the Sanskrit dative case has in most instances been replaced by the genitive in Pali. Thus in the phrase <i class="calibre9">Namo tassa Bhagavato Arahato Sammā-Sambuddhassa</i>  (Homage to the Blessed One, the Arahant, fully-enlightened Buddha) the words <i class="calibre9">tassa</i> etc are originally genitive forms with dative meaning. However we do find the expression <i class="calibre9">namo Buddhāya</i> (homage to the Buddha) with a true dative form.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Those who wish to learn some Pali &mdash; which is to be encouraged! - should start with Johansson and proceed to Warder (see Bibliography). Sanskrit is a difficult language, but Michael Coulson’s ‘Teach Yourself’ volume (1976) renders it as painless as possible.</div>

<h1 class="fmh1">
THE LIFE OF THE BUDDHA</h1>
<div class="fmtx">Siddhattha Gotama (in Sanskrit, Siddhartha Gautama), who became the Buddha, the Enlightened One, may have lived from about 563-483 B.C., through many modern scholars suggest a later dating.<a id="calibre_link-348" href="#calibre_link-1781" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">1</sup></a> Oriental traditions offer a number of alternative datings, that favoured in Sri Lanka and south-east Asia being 623-543. It  was on this basis that the 2500th anniversary of his passing into final Nibbāna was celebrated, as <i class="calibre9">Buddha Jayanti,</i> in the East in 1956-57. He belonged to the Sakya clan dwelling on the edge of the Himalayas, his actual birthplace being a few miles north of the present-day Indian border, in Nepal. His father, Suddhodana, was in fact an elected chief of the clan rather than the king he was later made out to be, though his title was <i class="calibre9">rājā-a</i>  term which only partly corresponds to our word ‘king’. Some of the states of North India at that time were kingdoms and others republics, and the Sakyan republic was subject to the powerful king of neighbouring Kosala, which lay to the south.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Disentangling the probable facts from the mass of legend surrounding Gotama’s life, we may assume the following to be approximately correct. Though brought up to a life of luxury, the young prince was overcome by a sense of the essentially sorrowful aspect of life, and he decided to seek the cause and cure of this state which he termed <i class="calibre9">dukkha</i> (conventionally but inadequately rendered ‘suffering’ in English). At the age of twenty-nine he renounced the world, going forth ‘from the household life into homelessness’ in accordance with an already well-established tradition, thus joining the ranks of the wandering ascetics <i class="calibre9">(samaṇas:</i> see p. 22). He went successively to two teachers, Āḷāra Kālāma and Uddaka Rāmaputta, who taught him how to attain to high meditative states. Realising, however, that even the attainment of these states did not solve his problem, Gotama went off on his own and practised severe austerities for six years, gathering a little group of five ascetics around him. However, finding that even the most extreme forms of asceticism likewise did not lead to the goal, he abandoned these excesses, and sat down at the foot of a tree by the river Nerañjarā, at the place now known as Bodh Gaya, determined not to arise from the spot until enlightenment should dawn. During that night he passed beyond the meditative stages he had previously reached, and attained to complete liberation as the Buddha-the Enlightened or Awakened One. He spent the remaining forty-five years of his life wandering up and down the Ganges Valley, expounding the doctrine that he had found and establishing the Sangha or Order of Buddhist monks and nuns, which still exists today.</div>

<h1 class="fmh1">
HISTORICAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL BACKGROUND TO THE BUDDHA’S TIMES</h1>
<h2 class="fmh2">
<i class="calibre10">‘Ascetics and Brahmins’</i> </h2>
<div class="fmtx">India in the Buddha’s day did not yet suffer from the grinding poverty of the present time. The modern caste system had not fully developed, but we find its germ in the division of society into four groups or ‘colours’ (Pali <i class="calibre9">vaṇṇā).</i> The designation betrays the origin of the distinction, being based on the conquest of northern India in about 1600 B.C. by the comparatively light-skinned Aryans, who looked down on those of darker hue they found there. In the context of Buddhism, where this racial and aristocratic term (literally ‘noble’) is applied to the nobility of the spirit, we shall use the form Ariyan, based on Pali.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">The Brahmins were the guardians of the religious cult brought into India by the Aryans. In later, non-Buddhist sources we always hear of the Brahmins as taking the leading place in society. Buddhist sources, however (Sutta 3, for example), assert the supremacy of the Khattiyas (Skt. <i class="calibre9">kṣatriya),</i>  the Noble or Warrior class to which Gotama belonged. It appears that while further west the Brahmins had already established their supremacy, this was not yet the case in the Ganges valley. In the third place came the Vessas (Skt. <i class="calibre9">vaiśya)</i>  or merchants, and finally the Suddas (Skt. <i class="calibre9">śudra)</i> or workers. Below these there were certainly some slaves (we even hear of a Sudda having a slave), and some unfortunates of the class who were later to become known as ‘untouchables’. But in addition to these groupings, there were considerable numbers of people, including at least a few women, who had opted out of conventional society.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">In the texts we frequently meet with the compound <i class="calibre9">samaṇabrāhmaṇā,</i>  which we render ‘ascetics and Brahmins’. While the Pali Text Society dictionary correctly states that this compound expression denotes quite generally ‘leaders in religious life’, it is also true that the two groups were usually rivals.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">The religious situation in northern India around 500 B.C. is very interesting, and was undoubtedly exceptionally favourable to the development of the Buddhist and other faiths.  Though the Brahmins formed an important and increasingly powerful hereditary priesthood, they were never, like their counterparts elsewhere, able to assert their undisputed authority by persecuting and perhaps exterminating other religious groups. It seems that some Brahmins would not have been averse to such a course, but it was not open to them. They were a caste set aside from other men (in reading about them in the Buddhist texts, one is insistently reminded of the New Testament picture of the Pharisees, though in both cases the picture presented is, to say the least, one-sided). They alone were learned in the Three Vedas, knew the mystic mantras, and could conduct the all-important, bloody and expensive sacrifices. In fact, not all Brahmins exercised their priestly functions; some had settled down to agriculture or even trade, while continuing to expect the deference which they regarded as their due.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">The earlier (Dravidian?) inhabitants who had been overrun by the Aryans were the creators of the Indus Valley civilisation with the great cities of Harappā and Mohenjo Dāro, all now in Pakistan. And it is to this civilisation that we must look for the origins of the second stream of religious life, that of the <i class="calibre9">samanas</i>  (Skt. <i class="calibre9">śramaṇas).</i> These have sometimes been absurdly called ‘recluses’, whereas the term really means the very opposite. True, a <i class="calibre9">samaṇa</i> might occasionally be a recluse, a hermit shut away from the world in a rocky cell, but the more usual type was a wandered who had indeed ’abandoned the world’ to lead a more or less ascetic life. He - or, rarely, she - was in fact, to use a modern expression, a drop-out from society, though differing from our modern drop-outs in at least one important respect: the <i class="calibre9">samaṇas</i> as a group received no less respect from all classes, even kings, than did the Brahmins (see Sutta 2, verse 25ff.). Their teachings were many and varied &mdash; some wise and some exceedingly foolish, some loftily spiritual and some crudely materialistic. The point is that they were completely free to teach whatever they pleased, and, so far from being persecuted as they might have been elsewhere, were received with honour wherever they went. We can distinguish several different groups of these people. There were in particular the selfmortifiers on the one hand, and the wanderers on the other,  whose only austerity probably consisted in their detachment from family ties and, in theory at least, their observance of chastity. Many of the bizarre and often revolting practices of the first group are detailed in Sutta 8, verse 14. As pointed out in a note to that Sutta, the practice of extreme austerity (<i class="calibre9">tapas</i>) should not be called ‘penance’ because the motivation is entirely different from that of a Christian penitent, to whom such people might be superficially compared. The word <i class="calibre9">tapas,</i> which basically means ‘heat’, is used both for the austere practices indulged in and for the result they are intended to achieve, which is power, that is, the development of various paranormal powers. The belief was that these could be achieved by means of such practices and, in particular, by sexual restraint. Thus, so far from practising austerity like the Christian penitent, to atone for past sins, they undertook these practices in the hope of future powers, including, perhaps, those very joys that had been temporarily renounced.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">The wanderers <i class="calibre9">(paribbājakas),</i> some of whom were Brahmins, wore clothes (unlike many of the others, who went completely naked), and they led a less uncomfortable life. They were ‘philosophers’ who propounded many different theories about the world and nature, and delighted in disputation. The Pali Canon introduces us to six well-known teachers of the time, all of whom were older than Gotama. They are Pūraṇa Kassapa, an amoralist, Makkhali Gosāla, a determinist, Ajita Kesakambali, a materialist, Pakudha Kaccāyana, a categorialist, the Nigantha Nātaputta (the Jain leader known to us as Mahāvīra), who was a relativist and eclectic, and Sañjaya Belatthaputta, an agnostic sceptic or positivist (I borrow most of the descriptive epithets from Jayatilleke). Their different views are quoted by King Ajātasattu in Sutta 2, verses 16-32.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Besides these there were the propounders of the originally secret teaching incorporated in the Upanisads which came to be grafted on to orthodox Brahmanism, and whose doctrines were later to form the core of the Vedānta system. For them, the impersonal Brahman is the supreme reality, and the goal of the teaching is the realisation that the individual human soul or self  <i class="calibre9">(ātman)</i> is ultimately identical with the universal Self (<i class="calibre9">Ātman</i>), which is another term for Brahman (the capitalisation here is  merely for clarity: the teaching was at first and for long oral, and even when written down in an Oriental alphabet, such a distinction could not be made, since capital letters do not exist in any Eastern script). These <i class="calibre9">aupaniṣadas</i> are not mentioned in the Pali Canon, though it is almost (but not, perhaps, quite) certain that Gotama was acquainted with their teachings.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">It has been urged that ‘at depth there is no contradiction between the greatest insights of the Upanisads and the Buddha’s teaching’ - a view that would be contested by many. We shall return very briefly to this point later (page 31). Suffice it to say here that any theory that the Buddha taught a doctrine of a supreme Self can only be said to fly in the face of the evidence. Nor is it true, as is sometimes said, that in ancient India everybody believed in karma (the law of moral cause and effect) and rebirth, or indeed in anything else. There were, as we have seen, materialists, sceptics and equivocators, and all sorts of fantastic theorists. Neither can we accept the statement that the Buddha was ‘a Hindu who sought to reform the ancient religion’. Apart from the anachronistic use of the term ‘Hindu’, this is wrong because he rejected the claims of the Brahmins as religious authorities and, while not totally denying the existence of their gods, assigned to these a fundamentally unimportant role in the scheme of things. In so far as he belonged to any existing tradition, it was that of the <i class="calibre9">samaṇas,</i> and like them he taught as he saw fit. As a teacher he was not beholden to anyone: he agreed or disagreed with tradition or the views of others entirely in accordance with his sovereign perception of the truth. It is, however, correct to say that the situation in India in his time was particularly favourable to the spread of his teaching, while the Teacher’s long life enabled this to become firmly established in his lifetime and under his direction.</div>
<div class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-2413" class="calibre2"></a></div>
<h1 class="fmh1">
MAIN POINTS OF THE TEACHING</h1>
<div class="fmtx">The main points of the Buddha’s teaching need only be briefly summarised here. In his first sermon (Samyutta Nikāya 56.11) the Buddha taught that there were two extremes to be avoided: over-indulgence in sensuality on the one hand, and self-torture  on the other. He had had personal experience of both. Buddhism is thus the middle way between these extremes, and also between some other pairs of opposites, such as eternalism and annihilationism (see Sutta 1, verse 1.30ff. and verse 3.9ff.).</div>
<h2 class="fmh1">
<i class="calibre10">The Four Noble Truths</i> </h2>
<div class="fmtx">The most succinct formulation of the teaching is in the form of the Four Noble Truths:<div class="lsl">1. Suffering <i class="calibre9">(dukkha)</i>;</div><div class="lsl">2. The Origin of Suffering (<i class="calibre9">dukkha-samudaya</i>), which is craving  <i class="calibre9">(taṇhā);</i> </div><div class="lsl">3. The Cessation of Suffering <i class="calibre9">(dukkha-nirodha);</i> </div><div class="lsl">4. The Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering <i class="calibre9">(dukkha-nirodha-gamini-patipada),</i>  which is the Noble Eightfold Path  <i class="calibre9">(ariya-aṭṭhangika-magga).</i> This consists of:</div><div class="lsl">1. Right View (<i class="calibre9">sammā-diṭṭhi</i>) (N.B. singular, not Right Views!)</div><div class="lsl">2. Right Thought (<i class="calibre9">sammā-sankappa</i>)</div><div class="lsl">3. Right Speech (<i class="calibre9">sammā-vacā</i>)</div><div class="lsl">4. Right Action <i class="calibre9">(sammā-kammanta)</i> </div><div class="lsl">5. Right Livelihood <i class="calibre9">(sammā-ājīva)</i> </div><div class="lsl">6. Right Effort <i class="calibre9">(sammā-vāyāma)</i> </div><div class="lsl">7. Right Mindfulness (<i class="calibre9">sammā-sati</i>)</div><div class="lsl">8. Right Concentration (<i class="calibre9">sammā-samādhi)</i>.</div></div>
<div class="fmtx">For a full account of these, see Sutta 22, verses 18-22.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">The eight steps can be subsumed under the three heads of I. Morality <i class="calibre9">(sīla)</i> (steps 3 &mdash; 5), II. Concentration <i class="calibre9">(samādhi)</i> (steps 6 &mdash; 8), and III. Wisdom (<i class="calibre9">paññā</i>) (steps 1-2). It will be noticed that in this arrangement the order is different. This is because, while some preliminary wisdom is needed to start on the path, the final flowering of the higher wisdom follows after development of morality and concentration (cf. Sutta 33, verse 3.3(6)).</div>
<h2 class="fmh1">
<i class="calibre10">Stages on the Path</i> </h2>
<div class="fmtx">Progress on the path leading to the cessation of suffering, and hence to Nibbāna, is described in many places, notably in Sutta 2, in a long passage which is repeated verbatim in the following Suttas.<a id="calibre_link-349" href="#calibre_link-1782" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">2</sup></a> The most fundamental meditative exercise is set forth  in Sutta 22. The breakthrough to the transcendental is achieved in four stages, each of which is subdivided into two: path (<i class="calibre9">magga</i>) and fruition <i class="calibre9">(phala).</i> By attaining the first of these stages one ceases to be a mere ‘worldling’ <i class="calibre9">(puthujjana)</i> and becomes a noble person <i class="calibre9">(ariya-puggala).</i> The stages or ‘path-moments’ are designated in terms of the successive breaking of ten fetters. Standard descriptions of these stages are given at many places.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">At the first stage, one ‘enters the Stream’ and thus becomes a Stream-Winner <i class="calibre9">(sotāpanna)</i> by an experience also referred to (for example, in Sutta 2, verse 102) as the ‘opening of the Dhamma-eye’. The first path-moment is immediately followed by the fruition <i class="calibre9">(phala),</i> and likewise with the other three paths. At First Path, one is said to have ‘glimpsed Nibbāna’ (cf.  <i class="calibre9">Visuddhimagga</i> 22.126), and thereby three of the five lower fetters are discarded for ever: 1. personality-belief <i class="calibre9">(sakkāyadiṭṭhi</i>  ), that is, belief in a self; 2. doubt <i class="calibre9">(vicikicchā)</i> and 3. attachment to rites and rituals <i class="calibre9">(sῑlabbata-parāmāsa).</i> In other words, having had a glimpse of reality and perceived the falsity of the self-belief, one is unshakeable and no more dependent on external aids. One who has gained this state can, it is said, no longer be born in ‘states of woe’ and is assured of attaining Nibbāna after, at the most, seven more lives.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">At the second stage, one becomes a Once-Returner <i class="calibre9">(sakadāgāmī),</i>  in whom the fourth and fifth lower fetters are greatly weakened: 4. sensual desire <i class="calibre9">(kāma-rāga)</i> and 5. ill-will <i class="calibre9">(vyāpāda</i>  ). Such a person will attain to Nibbana after at most one further human rebirth. It is interesting to note that sensuality and ill-will are so powerful that they persist, in however attenuated a form, for so long.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">At the third stage, one becomes a Non-Returner <i class="calibre9">(anāgāmī),</i> in whom the fourth and fifth fetters are completely destroyed. In such a person all attachments to this world have ceased, and at death one will be reborn in a higher world, in one of the Pure Abodes (see <i class="calibre9">Cosmology</i> p. 42), and will attain Nibbāna from there without returning to this world. It may be mentioned that in Samyutta Nikāya 22.89 the Venerable Khemaka actually gives some account of what it feels like to be a Non-Returner.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Finally, at the fourth stage, one becomes an Arahant (Sanskrit  <i class="calibre9">Arhat</i>, literally ‘worthy one’), by the destruction of the five higher fetters: 6. craving for existence in the Form World  <i class="calibre9">(rūpa-rāga),</i> 7. craving for existence in the Formless World  <i class="calibre9">(arūpa-rāga)</i> (see p. 42 for more about these), 8. conceit <i class="calibre9">(māna),</i> 9. restlessness <i class="calibre9">(uddhacca),</i> 10. ignorance <i class="calibre9">(avijjā).</i> For such a one, the task has been completed, and that person will attain final Nibbana ‘without remainder’ at death.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">It should perhaps be added that there are two different ideas that are widely circulated in the East. One is that in this degenerate age it is not possible to become an Arahant. The other, less pessimistic view is that while lay persons can attain to the first three paths, only monks can become Arahants. There is no scriptural authority for either idea. It should also be mentioned that the Arahant ideal is one that is perfectly valid for all schools of Buddhism. Likewise, the concept of the Bodhisattva, who renounces the enjoyment of Nirvana in order to bring all beings to enlightenment, which is considered the hallmark of the Mahayana schools as opposed to the Hīnayāna,<a id="calibre_link-350" href="#calibre_link-1783" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">3</sup></a>  in fact exists in Theravada Buddhism as well. The difference of schools is one of emphasis, and does not constitute the unbridgeable gap imagined by some, chiefly in the West. But it cannot be our task to enter further into these matters here.</div>
<h2 class="fmh1">
<i class="calibre10">Nibbāna or Nirvāṇa</i> </h2>
<div class="fmtx">The Sanskrit form is better known in the West than the Pali  <i class="calibre9">Nibbāna.</i> There are, not surprisingly, many misapprehensions about this. In fact it has been said by one witty scholar that all we have to go on is our misconception of Nirvana, because until we have realised it we cannot know it as it really is. But if we cannot say much about what it is, we can at least say something about what it is <i class="calibre9">not</i>. Robert Caesar Childers, in his famous and still useful Pali dictionary (1875), devoted a whole long article, in fact a short treatise, to proving to his own satisfaction that Nibbana implies total extinction, and this view, though certainly erroneous, is still to be met with among some Western scholars. And yet, it would be odd indeed if Buddhists were supposed to have to tread the entire path right up to the attainment of Arahantship merely in order to finish  up with that total obliteration which the materialists, and many ordinary people today, assume to occur for all of us, good, bad and indifferent, at the end of our present life. It is true, some colour is given to this idea by the etymology of the term (nir + √vā = ‘blowing out’ as of a lamp). Contrasted with this, however, we find other very different descriptions of Nibbāna. Thus in Sutta 1.3.20 it is used for ‘the highest happiness’, defined as the indulgence in the pleasures of the five senses &mdash; obviously a non-Buddhist use of the word, though it is not otherwise attested in pre-Buddhist sources. We thus find two apparently contradictory meanings of Nibbana: 1. ‘extinction’, 2. ‘highest bliss’. And while these were wrongly used in the examples quoted, they both occur in authentic texts.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">In considering this problem, it is as well to note the words of the Venerable Nyāṇatiloka in his <i class="calibre9">Buddhist Dictionary</i>:<div class="afmtx"><div class="fmtx2">One cannot too often and too emphatically stress the fact that not only for the actual realization of the goal of Nibbāna, but also for a theoretical understanding of it, it is an indispensable preliminary condition to grasp fully the truth of Anattā, the egolessness and insubstantiality of all forms of existence. Without such an understanding, one will necessarily misconceive Nibbāna - according to one’s either materialistic or metaphysical leanings &mdash; either as annihilation of an ego, or as an eternal state of existence into which an Ego or Self enters or with which it merges.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx">What this in effect means is that in order to ‘understand’ Nibbāna one should have ‘entered the Stream’ or gained First Path, and thus have got rid of the fetter of personality-belief. While scholars will continue to see it as part of their task to try to understand what the Buddha meant by Nibbāna, they should perhaps have sufficient humility to realise that this is something beyond the range of purely scholarly discussion. In the systematisation of the Abhidhamma (see p. 52), Nibbāna is simply included as the ‘unconditioned element’ <i class="calibre9">(asankhatadhātu),</i>  but with no attempt at definition. Nibbāna is indeed the  extinction of the ‘three fires’ of greed, hatred and delusion, or the destruction of the ‘corruptions’ <i class="calibre9">(āsavā)</i> of sense-desire, becoming, wrong view and ignorance. Since the individual ‘self’ entity is not ultimately real, it cannot be said to be annihilated in Nibbāna, but the <i class="calibre9">illusion</i> of such a self is destroyed.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Very oddly, in the <i class="calibre9">Pali-English Dictionary</i>, it is said that Nibbana is ‘purely and simply an ethical state ... It is therefore not transcendental.’ In fact it is precisely the one and only transcendental element in Buddhism, for which very reason no attempt is made to define it in terms of a personal god, a higher self, or the like. It is ineffable. It can, however, be realised, and its realisation is the aim of the Buddhist practice. While no description is possible, positive references to Nibbana are not lacking: thus at Dhammapada 204 and elsewhere it is called ‘the highest bliss’ <i class="calibre9">(paramam sukhaṁ),</i> and we may conclude this brief account with the famous quotation from Udana 8.3:<div class="afmtx"><div class="fmtx2">There is, monks, an Unborn, Unbecome, Unmade, Uncompounded <i class="calibre9">(ajātaṁ abhūtaṁ akataṁ asankhataṁ).</i>  If there were not this Unborn ..., then there would be no deliverance here visible from that which is born, become, made, compounded. But since there is this Unborn, Unbecome, Unmade, Uncompounded, therefore a deliverance is visible from that which is born, become, made, compounded.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx">This is, at the same time, perhaps the best answer we can give concerning the Upanisadic <i class="calibre9">Ātman</i>. Buddhism teaches no such thing &mdash; nevertheless the above quotation could certainly be applied to the <i class="calibre9">Ātman</i> as understood in Vedanta, or indeed to the Christian conception of God. However, to the followers of those faiths it would be an insufficient description, and the additions they would make would for the most part be unacceptable to Buddhists. It can, however, be suggested that this statement represents the fundamental basis of all religions worthy of the name, as well as providing a criterion to distinguish true religion from such surrogates as Marxism, humanism and the like.</div>
<h2 class="fmh1">
<i class="calibre10">The Three Marks (tilakkhaṇa)</i> </h2>
<div class="fmtx">The formula of the three marks (also referred to as ‘signs of being’, ‘signata’, etc.) is found in many places (in expanded, versified form Dhammapada 277-9). It runs:<div class="lsl">1. ‘All <i class="calibre9">sankhāras</i><a id="calibre_link-351" href="#calibre_link-1784" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">4</sup></a> (compounded things) are impermanent’: Sabbe  <i class="calibre9">sankhārā aniccā</i> </div><div class="lsl">2. ‘All <i class="calibre9">sankhāras</i> are unsatisfactory’: Sabbe <i class="calibre9">sankhārā dukkhā</i> </div><div class="lsl">3. ‘All <i class="calibre9">dhammas</i> (all things including the unconditioned) are without self’: <i class="calibre9">Sabbe dhammā anattā</i> </div></div>
<div class="fmtx">The first and second of these marks apply to all mundane things, everything that ‘exists’ <i class="calibre9">(sankhāra</i> in its widest sense). The third refers in addition to the unconditioned element  <i class="calibre9">(a-sankhata,</i> that is, not a <i class="calibre9">sankhdra,</i> thus Nibbāna). This does not ‘exist’ (relatively), but IS.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Thus, nothing lasts for ever, all things being subject to change and disappearance. Nothing is completely satisfactory: <i class="calibre9">dukkha,</i>  conventionally rendered ‘suffering’, has the wide meaning of not satisfying, frustrating, painful in whatever degree. Even pleasant things come to an end or cease to attract, and the painful aspect of life is too well-known and ubiquitous to need discussion.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">The first two marks can perhaps be appreciated without too much effort, even though their profound penetration is more difficult. It is the third mark that has provoked much controversy and misunderstanding.</div>
<div class="fmtx1"><i class="calibre9">An-attā</i> (Skt. <i class="calibre9">an-ātman)</i> is the negative of <i class="calibre9">attā/ātman</i> ‘self’. So much is clear. In ordinary usage <i class="calibre9">attā</i> is a pronoun used for all persons and genders, singular and plural, meaning ‘myself’, ‘herself’, ‘ourselves’, ‘themselves’, etc. It has no metaphysical implications whatsoever. This, then, is the self of daily life, which has a purely relative and conventional reality if only because it is an almost indispensable expression in everyday speech. As a noun, <i class="calibre9">attā</i> to the Buddhist means an imaginary entity, a so-called ‘self’, which is not really there. The five  <i class="calibre9">khandhas</i> or aggregates, the various parts that make up our empirical personality (see Sutta 22, verse 14), do not constitute a self, either individually or collectively. Our so-called ‘self’,  then, is something bogus. It is, however, a concept that we cling to with great tenacity. See further, p. 32.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">It was said earlier that any theory that the Buddha taught such a doctrine as the Upanisadic Higher Self can only be said to fly in the face of the evidence. This is borne out by the third mark: all <i class="calibre9">dhammas</i> are without self. The term <i class="calibre9">dhamma</i> here includes Nibbāna, the Buddhist ultimate. Thus this is expressly stated not to be any kind of ‘Higher Self’. There are those who believe that what the Buddha taught and what the Upanisads taught must agree. Be that as it may at some deeper level, the expression is certainly different. It is arguable that the Buddha considered the term ‘self’, which to him was something evanescent, to be ludicrously inappropriate to the supreme reality, whatever its nature. To pursue such arguments as this any further is surely fruitless.</div>
<h2 class="fmh1">
<i class="calibre10">Levels of Truth</i> </h2>
<div class="fmtx">An important and often overlooked aspect of the Buddhist teaching concerns the levels of truth, failure to appreciate which has led to many errors (see n. 220). Very often the Buddha talks in the Suttas in terms of conventional or relative truth (sammuti-or  <i class="calibre9">vohāra-sacca),</i> according to which people and things exist just as they appear to the naive understanding. Elsewhere, however, when addressing an audience capable of appreciating his meaning, he speaks in terms of ultimate truth (<i class="calibre9">paramattha</i>-<i class="calibre9">sacca</i>), according to which ‘existence is a mere process of physical and mental phenomena within which, or beyond which, no real ego-entity nor any abiding substance can ever be found’ (<i class="calibre9">Buddhist Dictionary</i> under <i class="calibre9">Paramattha</i>). In the Abhidhamma, the entire exposition is in terms of ultimate truth. It may also be observed that many ‘Zen paradoxes’ and the like really owe their puzzling character to their being put in terms of ultimate, not of relative truth. The full understanding of ultimate truth can, of course, only be gained by profound insight, but it is possible to become increasingly aware of the distinction. There would seem in fact to be a close parallel in modern times in the difference between our naive world-view and that of the physicist, both points of view having their use  in their own sphere. Thus, conventionally speaking, or according to the naive world-view, there are solid objects such as tables and chairs, whereas according to physics the alleged solidity is seen to be an illusion, and whatever might turn out to be the ultimate nature of matter, it is certainly something very different from that which presents itself to our senses. However, when the physicist is off duty, he or she makes use of solid tables and chairs just like everyone else.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">In the same way, all such expressions as ‘I’, ‘self’ and so on are always in accordance with conventional truth, and the Buddha never hesitated to use the word <i class="calibre9">attā</i> ‘self’ (and also with plural meaning: ‘yourselves’, etc.)<a id="calibre_link-352" href="#calibre_link-1785" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">5</sup></a> in its conventional and convenient sense. In fact, despite all that has been urged to the contrary, there is not the slightest evidence that he ever used it in any other sense except when critically quoting the views of others, as should clearly emerge from several of the Suttas here translated.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">In point of fact, it should be stressed that conventional truth is sometimes extremely important. The whole doctrine of karma and rebirth has its validity only in the realm of conventional truth. That is why, by liberating ourselves from the viewpoint of conventional truth we cease to be subject to karmic law. Objections to the idea of rebirth in Buddhism, too, are sometimes based on a misunderstanding of the nature of the two truths. As long as we are unenlightened ‘worldlings’, our minds habitually operate in terms of ‘me’ and ‘mine’, even if in theory we know better. It is not until this tendency has been completely eradicated that full enlightenment can dawn. At Saṁyutta Nikāya 22.89 the Venerable Khemaka, who is a Non-Returner, explains how ‘the subtle remnant of the ‘I’-conceit, of the ‘I’-desire, an unextirpated lurking tendency to think: ‘I am”, still persists even at that advanced stage.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Probably the best account of the Buddha’s attitude to truth is given by Jayatilleke in <i class="calibre9">The Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge</i>  (1963, 361ff.). It may be mentioned that for those who find this work hard going, his second, posthumous book, <i class="calibre9">The Message of the Buddha</i> (1975), makes for easier reading. Jayatilleke has been attacked for equating the philosophy of Buddhism too closely  with the modern school of logical positivism. In this connection it is perhaps best to let him speak for himself:<div class="afmtx"><div class="fmtx2">The Buddha, again, was the earliest thinker in history to recognise the fact that language tends to distort in certain respects the nature of reality and to stress the importance of not being misled by linguistic forms and conventions. In this respect, he foreshadowed the modern linguistic or analytical philosophers. (<i class="calibre9">The Message of the Buddha,</i> 33).</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx">It seems hard to find any fault with that. Jayatilleke goes on:<div class="afmtx"><div class="fmtx2">He was the first to distinguish meaningless questions and assertions from meaningful ones. As in science he recognised perception and inference as the twin sources of knowledge, but there was one difference. For perception, according to Buddhism, included extra-sensory forms as well, such as telepathy and clairvoyance. Science cannot ignore such phenomena and today there are Soviet as well as Western scientists, who have admitted the validity of extra-sensory perception in the light of experimental evidence.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx">Probably most readers will concede the possibility that the Buddha knew a few things which modern science is only now beginning to discover, or accept. We will leave it at that.</div>
<h2 class="fmh1">
<i class="calibre10">Kamma</i> </h2>
<div class="fmtx">The Sanskrit form of this word, <i class="calibre9">karma,</i> is more familiar to Westerners, but as its meaning in non-Buddhist contexts is not necessarily always the same as in Buddhism, there is some advantage in using the Pali form kamma here. The literal meaning of the word is ‘action’, and at Anguttara Nikaya 6.63 the Buddha defines it as volition <i class="calibre9">(cetanā).</i> It is therefore any deliberate act, good or bad (in Pali <i class="calibre9">kusala</i> ‘skilful, wholesome’ or  <i class="calibre9">akusala</i> ‘unskilful, unwholesome’). A good act will normally lead to pleasant results for the doer, and a bad act to unpleasant  ones. The correct Pali (and Sanskrit) word for such results is  <i class="calibre9">vipāka</i> (‘ripening’), though karma/kamma tends in practice to be used loosely for the results as well as the deeds that produced them &mdash; even sometimes by those who really know better. But it is as well to be aware of the correct distinction.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">The question is sometimes asked whether there is free-will in Buddhism. The answer should be clear: each karmic act is the exercise of a choice, good or bad. Thus though our actions are limited by conditions, they are not totally determined.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">In this computerised age, it may be helpful to some to think of kamma as ‘programming’ our future. Thus the ‘karma-formations’  <i class="calibre9">(sankhāras)</i> mentioned below are the ‘programme’ which we have &mdash; through ignorance &mdash; made in past lives. The aim of the practice, of course, is to get beyond all kamma. An account of how to progress towards this aim is given in many Suttas, and especially in the first division of the Digha Nikāya.</div>
<h2 class="fmh1">
<i class="calibre10">The Twelve Links of the Chain of Dependent Origination</i> </h2>
<div class="fmtx">This famous formulation is found in many places in the Canon, and is also represented visually in Tibetan <i class="calibre9">thangkas</i> in the form of a twelve-spoked wheel. The Pali term <i class="calibre9">paṭicca-samuppāda</i> (Skt.  <i class="calibre9">pratītya-samutpāda)</i> is usually rendered ‘dependent origination’, though Edward Conze preferred ‘conditioned co-production’. It has been much debated by Western scholars, some of whom produced some strange theories on the subject. The usual formulation is as follows:<div class="lsl">1. Ignorance conditions the ‘Karma-formations’ <i class="calibre9">(avijjāpaccayā sankhārā)</i> </div><div class="lsl">2. The Karma-formations condition Consciousness (<i class="calibre9">sankhārapaccayā viññāṇaṁ)</i> </div><div class="lsl">3. Consciousness conditions Mind-and-Body (lit. ‘Name-and-Form’ : <i class="calibre9">viññaṇa-paccayā nāma-rūpaṁ)</i> </div><div class="lsl">4. Mind-and-Body conditions the Six Sense-Bases <i class="calibre9">(nāmarūpa-paccayā saḷāyatanaṁ)</i> </div><div class="lsl">5. The Six Sense-Bases condition Contact <i class="calibre9">(saḷāyatana-paccayā phasso</i>)</div><div class="lsl">6. Contact conditions Feeling <i class="calibre9">(phassa-paccayā vedanā)</i> </div><div class="lsl">7. Feeling conditions Craving <i class="calibre9">(vedanā-paccayā taṇhā)</i> </div><div class="lsl">8. Craving conditions Clinging <i class="calibre9">(taṇhā-paccayā upādānaṁ)</i> </div><div class="lsl">9. Clinging conditions Becoming <i class="calibre9">(upādāna-paccayā</i> bhavo)</div><div class="lsl">10. Becoming conditions Birth <i class="calibre9">(bhava-paccayā jāti)</i> </div><div class="lsl">11. Birth conditions (12) Ageing-and-Death <i class="calibre9">(jāti-paccayā jarāmaraṇaṁ).</i> </div></div>
<div class="fmtx">This is best understood if taken in reverse order. In Sutta 15, verse 2 the Buddha says to Ananda: ‘If you are asked: “Has ageing-and-death a condition for its existence?” you should answer: “Yes.” If asked: “What conditions ageing-and-death?” you should answer: “Ageing-and-death is conditioned by birth’”, and so on. Thus, if there were no birth, there could be no ageing-and-death: birth is a necessary condition for their arising.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">According to the usual view, which is certainly correct but perhaps not the only way of regarding the matter, the twelve links <i class="calibre9">(niddnas)</i> are spread over three lives: 1-2 belonging to a past life, 3-10 to this present life, and 11-12 to a future life. Thus the development of our ‘karma-formations’ or behaviour patterns is due to past ignorance (that is, the fact that ‘we’ are not enlightened). These patterns condition the arising of a new consciousness in the womb, on the basis of which a new psycho-physical complex <i class="calibre9">(nāma-rūpa)</i> comes into being, equipped with the six sense-bases (of sight, hearing, smelling, tasting and touching, with mind as the sixth sense). Contact of any of these with a sense-object (sight, sound, etc.) produces feeling, which may be pleasant, unpleasant or neutral. On the basis of pleasant feeling, desire or craving arises. The links from consciousness to feeling are the results of past actions <i class="calibre9">(vipāka),</i>  whereas craving, clinging and the process of becoming are volitional (that is, <i class="calibre9">kamma</i>), and will therefore have results for the future. In fact they set in train the same process of (re)birth (due to ignorance) that we witnessed before, and birth must inevitably lead to death. This is the continuous process in which we, as unenlightened beings, are caught up.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Curiously, in the Digha Nikāya we do not find the twelve links. The steps from feeling to ageing-and-death are mentioned in Sutta 1, verse 3.71, while in the two main expositions in this book, the process in reverse is traced back only to its  starting-point in this life, that is, to consciousness arid mind-and-body, which are said to condition each other mutually. Thus, in Sutta 14, we have a set of ten steps instead of the usual twelve, while in Sutta 15, still more remarkably, the six sense-bases are omitted, thus making a total of only nine links. In other parts of the Canon there are occasional expansions beyond the twelve links give here, but this is the standard formula. It seems that the repeaters <i class="calibre9">(bhāṇakā)</i> of the Digha had a tradition of their own to which they firmly adhered.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">While we should certainly not make Ānanda’s mistake (Sutta 15, verse 1) of thinking the whole thing easy to understand, we can get some general grasp of it, especially if we regard the links in reverse order, which is the way the Buddha explained it to Ananda. At least we shall find that it is not so arbitrary or nonsensical as some Western scholars have supposed.</div>
<h2 class="fmh1">
<i class="calibre10">Rebirth</i> </h2>
<div class="fmtx">There are some people in the West who are attracted in many ways to Buddhism, but who find the idea of rebirth a stumbling-block, either because they find it distasteful and/or incredible in itself, or in some cases because they find it hard to reconcile with the ‘non-self’ idea. Some such considerations as any of these sometimes even lead people to declare that the Buddha did not actually teach rebirth at all, or that if he did so, this was only for popular consumption, because his hearers could not have accepted the truth. All such views are based on various kinds of misunderstanding.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">It should be noted, incidentally, that Buddhists prefer to speak, not of reincarnation, but of rebirth. Reincarnation is the doctrine that there is a transmigrating soul or spirit that passes on from life to life. In the Buddhist view we may say, to begin with, that that is merely what appears to happen, though in reality no such soul or spirit passes on in this way. In Majjhima Nikāya 38 the monk Sāti was severely rebuked for declaring that ‘this very consciousness’ transmigrates, whereas in reality a new consciousness arises at rebirth <i class="calibre9">dependent</i> on the old. Nevertheless there is an illusion of continuity in much the same way as there is within this life. Rebirth from life to life is in principle scarcely different from the rebirth from moment to  moment that goes on in this life. The point can be intellectually grasped, with a greater or less degree of difficulty, but it is only at the first path-moment, with the penetration of the spurious nature of what we call self, that it is clearly understood without a shadow of doubt remaining.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">It cannot be the purpose of this book to argue in favour of a belief in rebirth, but sceptics might do well to read <i class="calibre9">Rebirth as Doctrine and Experience</i> by Francis Story (Buddhist Publication Society 1975), which has an introduction by Ian Stevenson, Carlson Professor of Psychiatry in the University of Virginia. This book contains some case-histories from Thailand and elsewhere which are difficult to explain except on the rebirth hypothesis, and Prof. Stevenson, too, has published several volumes of research-findings of a similar nature from various parts of the world. It may be that the excessive credulity which characterised some previous ages has, in the present time, given way to equally excessive scepticism.</div>
<h2 class="fmh1">
<i class="calibre10">Cosmology</i> </h2>
<div class="fmtx">If we even provisionally accept the idea of rebirth, this almost necessarily requires acceptance of some kind of spirit-world or worlds. In the Buddhist scriptures we find a scheme of post-mortem worlds which, while having much in common with general Indian ideas, is in many of its details unique. Here, there are no eternal heavens or hells, though some of both are said to be tremendously long-lasting; but all is in an eternal flux in which worlds and world-systems are born and perish, and living beings are continually born, die and are reborn according to their karmic deserts. It is a grandiose, but ultimately frightening and horrifying vision. Deliverance from it is only possible through the insight engendered by following the path taught by one of the Buddhas who occasionally arise on the scene. For those who fail to gain this insight there can be a happy rebirth for a long time in one of the temporary heaven-worlds, but no permanent deliverance from the perils of birth-and-death. This is <i class="calibre9">saṁsāra</i> or cyclic existence, the ‘on-faring’.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">All existence in the various realms of saṁsāra is in one of the three worlds: the World of Sense-Desires <i class="calibre9">(kāma-loka),</i> the World of Form (or the ‘fine-material world’: <i class="calibre9">rūpa-loka)</i> and the Formless  (or ‘immaterial’) World <i class="calibre9">(arūpa-loka),-the</i> latter two of which are inhabited by those who have attained, in this life, the corresponding mental absorptions <i class="calibre9">(jhānas)</i> frequently described in the texts. Beyond all this lies the realm of the Supramundane (<i class="calibre9">lokuttara</i>) or Nibbāna &mdash; the ‘other shore’, the only secure haven. And this, though it can be experienced, cannot be described.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">There are thirty-one states in which, it is said, one can be reborn, distributed over the three worlds. The lowest of the three, the World of Sense-Desires, consists of the first eleven states, of which human rebirth is the fifth. Below this are the fourfold ‘states of woe’: hells, the world of asuras (sometimes rendered ‘titans’), of hungry ghosts (<i class="calibre9">petas</i>), and of animals, while above it are the six lowest heavens. Above these are the sixteen heavens of the World of Form, and above these again the four heavens of the Formless World.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Special importance attaches to the human condition, since it is next to impossible to gain enlightenment from any other sphere than this: the realms below the human are too miserable, and those above it too happy and carefree for the necessary effort to be easily made.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">The list as it stands show signs of late elaboration, but many of the spheres shown, or their inhabitants, are mentioned in the Suttas of this collection.</div>

EXPLANATIONS OF THE THIRTY-ONE ABODES</h1>
<h2 class="fmh2">
<i class="calibre10">The World of Sense Desires</i> </h2>
<div class="fmtx">1. Hells. The hell-states are often rendered ‘purgatory’ to indicate that they are not eternal. See n.244. Descriptions of the hells, their horrors and the length of time supposedly spent there, became increasingly lurid as time went on. In the Digha Nikaya there are no such descriptions, the kind and duration of suffering in such ‘states of woe’ being left quite vague. Jayatilleke (<i class="calibre9">The Message of the Buddha</i>, 251) quotes from the Samyutta Nikaya 36.4 (= S iv.206):<div class="afmtx"><div class="fmtx2">When the average ignorant person makes an assertion that there is a Hell <i class="calibre9">(pātāla)</i> under the ocean, he is making a statement that is false and without basis. The word ‘hell’ is a term for painful bodily sensations.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx">This certainly deserves more credence as a saying of the Buddha than the late Suttas Majjhima Nikaya 129, 130. See also  <i class="calibre9">Visuddhimagga</i> 13-93ff. for more on the first four abodes.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2. <i class="calibre9">Asuras</i>. See n-512. Rebirth among the asuras or titans is sometimes omitted from the list of separate destinations. In the Mahayana tradition they are often regarded more favourably than in the Pali Canon &mdash; perhaps a reminiscence of their earlier status as gods.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">3. <i class="calibre9">Hungry ghosts</i>. These unhappy creatures are depicted with enormous bellies and tiny mouths. They wander about the world in great distress, which can, however, be alleviated by generous offerings. The Petavatthu, the seventh book of the Khuddaka Nikaya and one of the latest portions of the Canon, has many strange tales about them.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">4. <i class="calibre9">The animal world.</i> The animal kingdom, together with the human realm, constitutes the only realm of beings normally visible to human sight and therefore indisputably existing (Ajita Kesakambali, like any modern rationalist, disbelieved in all the rest). There are those today in the West who object strongly to the idea that the Buddha taught that we can be reborn as animals, though at first sight the evidence is all against them. However, since <i class="calibre9">tiracchāna,</i> normally meaning  ‘animal’, is used in Sutta 1 in the compounds <i class="calibre9">ttracchāna-kathā, tiracchana-vijjā</i>, meaning ‘low talk’, ‘base art’, it is just possible that as a ‘destination’ for humans <i class="calibre9">tiracchāna-yoni</i> can be taken as a low rebirth. Some confirmation is provided by the case of Khorakkhattiya (Sutta 24, verse 9 and n.244).</div>
<div class="fmtx1">5. <i class="calibre9">The human world.</i> Rebirth as a human being is regarded as a great opportunity which should be seized, since it may not easily recur, and it is almost impossible to ‘enter the Stream’ and so start on the path to Nibbāna from any other condition (but see n.600). Beings in the states below the human are too miserable, fearful and benighted, and those above it are too happy to make the necessary effort. In the human world we encounter both joy and sorrow, often very evenly balanced, and it is also possible to attain to a state of equanimity which is favourable to progress. Nevertheless, most human beings are very much under the sway of sense-desires, as indeed are the inhabitants of the worlds immediately above this one.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">6. <i class="calibre9">The Realm of the Four Great Kings</i>. These kings are the guardians of the four quarters, and a lively account of existence on their plane is given in Sutta 20, to which reference should be made. The beings from here on are called devas, or in some cases alternatively Brahmās. Various kinds of non-human beings, not all of whom are beneficent, are supposed to be located in or associated with this realm, and are mentioned in Sutta 20. Since the inhabitants of this sphere (especially the gandhabbas, heavenly musicians and attendants on the kings and their followers) are still addicted to sense-pleasures, it is considered disgraceful for a monk to be reborn there. However, as we are told in Sutta 21, verse 11, it is possible for such to progress to a much higher plane if they make the effort.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">7. <i class="calibre9">The Thirty-Three</i> Gods. Their heaven had once been the abode of the asuras, who had been expelled from it. No list of the thirty-three exists, but their chief is Sakka (Sankrit <i class="calibre9">Śakra),</i>  who is either a reformed Indra or, as Rhys Davids considered, a Buddhist replacement for him. Many good people were reborn in this realm.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">8. <i class="calibre9">Yāma devas</i>. These devas are usually only mentioned in passing. The name is said to mean ‘those who have attained to divine bliss’, but may also relate to Yama, king of the dead. </div>
<div class="fmtx1">9. Contented devas. It is in their heaven that Bodhisattas reside before their last birth, and Once-Returners are also sometimes born here.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">10, 11. <i class="calibre9">Devas Delighting in Creation; devas Wielding Power over Others’ Creations.</i> The former can create any shape they like, the latter delight in things created by others, to get them in their power. These two are the highest in the World of Sense Desires.</div>
<h2 class="fmh1">
<i class="calibre10">The World of Form (Fine-Material</i> <i class="calibre10">World)</i> </h2>
<div class="fmtx">12. <i class="calibre9">The Retinue of Brahmā</i>. The inhabitants of abodes 12-21 are known as devas or Brahmas. Rebirth in these worlds is dependent on experience of the lower jhānas as well as moral behaviour. Those who live in them are free from sensual desire, though in most cases only by suppression through the jhānas, not by eradication.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">13-14<i class="calibre9">. Ministers of Brahmā and Great Brahmās.</i> See below.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">15-21. These are all worlds in which those who have experienced the lower jhānas may be reborn according to their development: thus the highest sphere, number 21, is inhabited by those who have had a strong experience of the fourth jhāna, and so on downwards.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">22. <i class="calibre9">Unconscious beings.</i> See n.65.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">23-27. These are the Pure Abodes in which Non-Returners are reborn, and whence they gain Nibbāna without returning to earth.</div>
<h2 class="fmh1">
<i class="calibre10">The Formless World (Immaterial World)</i> </h2>
<div class="fmtx">28-31. These correspond to the four higher jhānas of the Formless World, and rebirth in these realms depends on the attainment of these jhānas, as for numbers 12-21. Gotama attained to the Sphere of No-Thingness under his first teacher, Aḷārā Kālāma, and to the Sphere of Neither-Perception-Nor-Non-Perception under his second teacher Uddaka Rāmaputta. He thus reached the highest state attainable without breaking through to the Supramundane <i class="calibre9">(lokuttara)</i> which is ‘beyond the Three Worlds’.</div>
<div class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-2416" class="calibre2"></a></div>
<h1 class="fmh1">
SOME NAMES AND DESIGNATIONS</h1>
<h2 class="fmh2">
<i class="calibre10">Brahmā</i> </h2>
<div class="fmtx">In Buddhism there is not one Brahma or Great Brahma but many, and they are not immortal. The origin of the belief in Brahma as creator of the world is given in Sutta 1, verse 2.2ff., and a satirical picture of the boastful Great Brahma (who nevertheless is a true follower of the Buddha) is given in Sutta 11. But though not almighty or eternal, Brahmas are powerful and benevolent beings who are still believed, in Oriental Buddhist countries, to be able to bestow mundane favours (for example the Brahma shrine outside the Erawan Hotel in Bangkok). One Great Brahma, Sahampati, begged the newly-enlightened Buddha to teach those who had ‘little dust on their eyes’.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">There is no certain or even probable trace of the neuter Brahman in Pali scriptures. In Sutta 13 two young Brahmins consult the Buddha on how to attain to ‘union with Brahma’ or more correctly ‘fellowship with Brahma’. Rhys Davids has been accused of mistranslating <i class="calibre9">sahavyatā</i> here as ‘union’, thus implying a mystical union rather than merely belonging to the company of Brahma. But the Brahmins had explained to the Buddha that they were puzzled because different teachers interpreted the path to Brahma in different ways. Thus both interpretations may well be implied here.</div>
<h2 class="fmh1">
<i class="calibre10">Buddha</i> </h2>
<div class="fmtx">This is of course a generic term, not a proper name: Gotama was ‘the Buddha’, not just ‘Buddha’ (the same should apply to Christ ‘the Anointed’, but usage is against this). It is a past participle form meaning ‘awakened’, thus ‘enlightened’. Buddhas appear at vast intervals of time. Besides the fully-enlightened Buddha who teaches Dhamma to the world  <i class="calibre9">(Sammā-Sambuddha)</i> there is the ‘private Buddha’ <i class="calibre9">(Pacceka-</i><i class="calibre9">Buddha</i>), who is enlightened but does not teach. As time went on, a more and more elaborate Buddhology developed, the first beginnings of which can be seen here in Sutta 14. It was under the Buddha Dipankara, vast ages ago, that the Brahmin  Sumedha first made the determination to become a Buddha, which he finally did as the historical Buddha Gotama. See especially Sutta 14.</div>
<h2 class="fmh1">
<i class="calibre10">Deva</i> </h2>
<div class="fmtx">This word is difficult to translate, and in general I have retained the Pali form, though in the case of the Thirty-Three Gods I have called them such, since they constitute something of a pantheon like that found in ancient Greece and elsewhere, even though few of them are individually named. As will be seen from the table, the term deva is applied to the inhabitants of all or any of the states above the human, though those in the World of Form can also be called Brahmā &mdash; a term which is probably better restricted to the inhabitants of realm No. 14. The etymological meaning of <i class="calibre9">deva</i> is ‘bright, shining’ (related to Latin <i class="calibre9">deus</i>, <i class="calibre9">dīvus),</i> but the word is popularly associated with the root <i class="calibre9">div</i> ‘to play’.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Devas are said to be of three kinds: 1. Conventional, that is, kings and princes, who are addressed as ‘Deva!’ (hence the Indian idea of the ‘god-king’ &mdash; a title adopted by the kings of Cambodia but misapplied in modern times to the Dalai Lama!), 2. purified, that is, Buddhas and Arahants, and 3. spontaneously born <i class="calibre9">(uppattidevā),</i> that is, devas in the sense as used here. Besides the form <i class="calibre9">deva</i> (which is uncommon in the third sense in the singular), we find the abstract noun <i class="calibre9">devatā</i> used much like ‘deity’ in English. It should be noted that though this noun is grammatically feminine, it does not necessarily imply female sex. When it is wished to indicate the sex, the words <i class="calibre9">devaputta</i>  ‘deva’s son’ and <i class="calibre9">devadhītā</i> ‘deva’s daughter’ may be used, though as most devas are spontaneously reborn this should not be taken literally (however, there are some indications of sexual reproduction occurring in the lowest heavens: we learn from Suttas 20 and 21 that the gandhabba chief Timbaru had a daughter).</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Devas have all been human, and may be reborn again in human form, which in fact would be good fortune for them, as it is so much easier to gain enlightenment from the human state. In view of their former human state, it has been suggested  that they are not unlike spirits (in the Spiritualist sense); another suggested translation is ‘angels’, but on the whole it seemed best (with one slight exception noted) to retain the Pali term for these beings. (The word <i class="calibre9">Devachan</i> used by Theosophists is not in fact derived from <i class="calibre9">deva</i>, but is the Tibetan word  <i class="calibre9">bde-ba-can</i> ‘land of bliss’, rendering the Sanskrit <i class="calibre9">Sukhāvati</i>.)</div>
<h2 class="fmh1">
<i class="calibre10">Gandhabbas</i> </h2>
<div class="fmtx">Celestial musicians (see Suttas 20, 21), subject to Dhatarattha, the Great King of the East, they act as attendants on the devas, and are still much addicted to sense-pleasures.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">It was formerly thought that gandhabbas also presided at conception, but this is due to a misunderstanding of a passage in Majjhima Nikaya 38 where it is stated that a ‘gandhabba’ must be present in addition to a man and a woman for conception to take place. The word here means, as the commentaries explain, ‘being about to be born’, that is the new consciousness arising dependent on that of a being who has died.</div>
<h2 class="fmh1">
<i class="calibre10">Garudds</i> </h2>
<div class="fmtx">These are giant birds, ever at war with the nagas (except when, under the Buddha’s influence, a truce is called: Sutta 20, verse 11). The garudd <i class="calibre9">(khruth)</i> is the royal badge of Thailand. In Indian legend, Visnu rode on a garuḍā.</div>
<h2 class="fmh1">
<i class="calibre10">Nāgas</i> </h2>
<div class="fmtx">The most interesting and difficult of the various classes of non-human beings. Basically the term seems to apply to snakes, in particular the king cobra, but nāgas are also associated with elephants, probably on account of the snake- like trunk. They are very wise and powerful, though they suffer terribly from the attacks of the garuḍās. The term is often used for a great man, including the Buddha. But as Malalasekera writes <i class="calibre9">(Dictionary of Pali Proper Names</i> ii, 1355): ‘In the accounts given of the nagas, there is undoubtedly great confusion between the nagas as supernatural (sic!) beings, as snakes, and as the name of certain non-Aryan tribes, but the confusion is too difficult to unravel.’</div>
<h2 class="fmh1">
<i class="calibre10">Tathāgata</i> </h2>
<div class="fmtx">The word generally used by the Buddha in referring to himself or to other Buddhas, though it seemingly can apply to any Arahant. Etymologically it means either &mdash; <i class="calibre9">tathā-āgata</i> ‘thus come’ or <i class="calibre9">tathā-gata</i> ‘thus gone’. It would seem to be a way of indicating that ‘he who stands before you’ is not like other beings. For commentarial explanations, see Bhikkhu Bodhi’s separate translation of Sutta 1 (see n.11). The Digha commentury (see p. 50) gives no fewer than eight different explanations, and the Mahāyāna schools have many more.</div>
<h2 class="fmh1">
<i class="calibre10">Yakkhas</i> </h2>
<div class="fmtx">Yakkhas, who are subject to Vessavana, Great King of the North, are curiously ambivalent creatures, for reasons explained in Sutta 32, verse 2. Some are believers in the Buddha, but others, not wishing to keep the precepts, are hostile to the Dhamma, and they are in fact in the majority. Among the ‘good yakkhas’, however, we find (Sutta 19) Janavasabha, who had been King Bimbisāra of Magadha and a Stream-Winner! Later tradition insists more and more on the bad side of the yakkhas, who come to be regarded as ogres or demons pure and simple &mdash; with the female of the species being more deadly than the male.</div>
<div class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-2417" class="calibre2"></a></div>
<h1 class="fmh1">
THE PALI CANON</h1>
<div class="fmtx">According to tradition, the text of the Pali Canon was settled at a Council held at Rājagaha immediately after the Teacher’s passing, having been memorised by leading Elders, who were highly realised practitioners of the Dhamma. In fact it is clear that the collection as we have it originated over a longer period. The Canon was preserved in oral form until the first century B.C., when it became apparent that the sacred texts might vanish from the earth if they were not recorded in writing. They were accordingly written down under King Vaṭṭagāmanī at this time in Sri Lanka, though some portions may already have been committed to writing earlier. The feat of memory involved  in preserving such an extensive body of text orally for so long may seem extraordinary to us, but was quite usual in ancient India. Writing was certainly known in India in the Buddha’s time, but was not used for such purposes. It must, however, be remembered that in the course of forty-five years the Buddha preached, doubtless often in a standardised form (see p. 49), to many thousands of people, and that many of the monks and nuns had trained minds and memories, and will have known full well the meaning of what they were repeating.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">From about the time of the Second Council, held at Vesali a century after the Buddha’s passing, we hear of divisions and the formation of sects within the Order. This led eventually to the rise of the Mahayana schools. An up-to-date account of these developments can be found in A.K. Warder’s <i class="calibre9">Indian Buddhism</i>. Here we need merely note that the Theravada type of Buddhism was carried early to Ceylon, and later to Burma, Thailand and other parts of south-east Asia, whereas the forms of Buddhism that spread to Tibet, China, Japan and other more northerly regions were of the developed, Mahayana type. Portions of the early scriptures of some of the schools that arose have been preserved, either in Sanskrit or, very often, in Chinese and/or Tibetan translations. The Sanskrit of these texts is often very bad, but the attempt was clearly made to lend dignity to the teaching by using the classical language. We thus find that Buddhist terms are found in both Pali and Sanskrit forms, and while the Pali terms are doubtless older, the Sanskrit forms are sometimes better known to the Western reader. Thus Sanskrit <i class="calibre9">karma</i> is more often used by Westerners than Pali  <i class="calibre9">kamma,</i> Sanskrit <i class="calibre9">dharma</i> and <i class="calibre9">nirvāṇa</i> than Pali <i class="calibre9">dhamma</i> and  <i class="calibre9">nibbāna.</i></div>
<div class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-2418" class="calibre2"></a></div>
<h1 class="fmh1">
THE PALI LANGUAGE</h1>
<div class="fmtx">Strictly speaking, the word <i class="calibre9">Pāḷi</i> means ‘text’. But the expression  <i class="calibre9">Pāḷibhāsā,</i> meaning ‘language of the texts’, was early taken to be the name of the language itself. Its use is practically confined to Buddhist subjects, and then only in the Theravada school. Its exact origins are the subject of learned debate. While we cannot  go too deeply into the matter here, it may be said that the traditional equation with the language of the ancient kingdom of Magadha, and the assertion that Pali is, literally and precisely, the language spoken by the Buddha himself, cannot be sustained. All the same, the language the Buddha actually spoke was in all probability not very different from Pali.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">From the point of view of the non-specialist, we can think of Pali as a kind of simplified Sanskrit. Its development, like that of other early Indian dialects, can be thought of as similar to an early form of Italian just breaking away from Latin. A close parallel is found in the word for‘seven’, where Latin <i class="calibre9">septem</i> has become Italian <i class="calibre9">sette,</i> the pt being simplified by assimilation to  <i class="calibre9">tt.</i> The Sanskrit equivalent <i class="calibre9">sapta</i> is in Pali <i class="calibre9">satta</i>, and similar types of simplification are found in hundreds of words. The grammar, too, has been slightly simplified, though not nearly so much as that of Italian.<a id="calibre_link-353" href="#calibre_link-1786" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">6</sup></a> But the two languages are still so close that it is possible to convert whole passages of Sanskrit into Pali simply by making the necessary mechanical transpositions.<a id="calibre_link-354" href="#calibre_link-1787" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">7</sup></a>  See p. 17 for more details about the relationship between Pali and Sanskrit.</div>
<div class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-2419" class="calibre2"></a></div>
<h1 class="fmh1">
THIS TRANSLATION</h1>
<div class="fmtx">The text on which this translation is based is the Pali Text Society edition by T.W. Rhys Davids and J.E. Carpenter (3 volumes, 1890-1910).<a id="calibre_link-355" href="#calibre_link-1788" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">8</sup></a> I have made some slight use of the Thai translation as well as of Franke’s German one, and have also made a few corrections following the Ven. Buddhadatta, Ñāṇamoli and others, as indicated at the appropriate places.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">It must be pointed out that <i class="calibre9">any</i> translator of the Pali Canon is faced with peculiar difficulties, if only owing to the repetitiveness of the originals. Even the manuscripts contain numerous abridgements, and any translator must necessarily abridge a great deal more. I have dealt with repetitions in three ways. Long sections have been condensed into a few lines, which appear in italics and include the Sutta and verse numbers of the omitted passages. Where it is clear from the context what is being omitted I have simply used ellipses; where it is not clear I  have used ellipses as well as the Sutta and verse number. In doing so I have ensured that nothing of substance has been omitted. I have made no excisions on account of real or alleged lateness or inauthenticity or the like: such matters are left to the reader’s judgement, with an occasional note for guidance. I have as far as possible avoided the use of masculine nouns and pronouns where both sexes are implied. I have, however, always been guided by my understanding of the text, bearing in mind the many admonitions addressed specifically to monks, as well as the words of Brahmins and others who were undoubtedly ‘sexist’. I have also kept the masculine gender in a few cases where to do otherwise would have produced intolerable awkwardness or (in verse) spoilt the scansion. I have tried to convey as much as possible the style of the original, rendering it into an English which is, I hope, neither too archaic nor too hypermodern.<a id="calibre_link-356" href="#calibre_link-1789" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">9</sup></a></div>
<div class="fmtx1">I have permitted myself a few syntactic abridgements. Phrases like <i class="calibre9">Bhagavatā saddhiṃ sammodi sammodanīyaṁ kathaṁ sārāṇīyaṁ vītisāretvā,</i> which Rhys Davids renders: ‘He exchanged with the Blessed One the greetings and compliments of politeness and courtesy’, have been cut down, in this case to ‘exchanged courtesies with him’. As regards the designation  <i class="calibre9">Bhagavā,</i> I have used ‘the Lord’ in narration, varied occasionally in quoted speech with ‘the Blessed Lord’. Other translators have ‘the Blessed One’, ‘the Exalted One’, and so on.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">The repetitions in the Canon have probably two distinct sources. It is extremely likely that the Buddha himself developed a standard form for sermons, which he doubtless uttered verbatim, or nearly so, many thousands of times during his forty-five years’ ministry. He would seem to have gone on the principle which many teachers use and recommend to this day: ‘First tell them what you are going to say, then say it, then tell them what you have said.’ His disciples will then have extended this principle into a system of rigidly stereotyped phrases. The second source of repetition will have been inherent in the oral tradition itself, as is witnessed by oral literature all over the world. This is always characterised by long repetitive passages and stereotyped epithets and descriptions. This tendency will in the present instance have been reinforced by  the wish to preserve the Master’s words as accurately as possible. It should also be remembered that it was not all a mere matter of <i class="calibre9">mechanical</i> repetition, though this undoubtedly occurred occasionally too.</div>
<div class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-2420" class="calibre2"></a></div>
<h1 class="fmh1">
THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE PALI CANON</h1>
<div class="fmtx">Certainly, not all parts of the Pali Canon are equally old or can be literally taken to be the Buddha’s precise words. This is plain common sense and does not mean completely rejecting their authenticity. Recent research has gone far to vindicate the claim that the Pali Canon holds at least a prime place among our sources in the search for ‘original’ Buddhism, or, in fact, ‘what the Buddha taught’. No attempt can be made here to go into any detail concerning questions of authenticity, or of the chronological stratification of the materials found in the Digha Nikāya. Some indications of scholarly opinion on this subject can be found, especially, in Pande, <i class="calibre9">Studies in the Origins of Buddhism</i> (1967), though not all his findings are equally acceptable. Personally I believe that all, or almost all <i class="calibre9">doctrinal</i> statements put directly into the mouth of the Buddha can be accepted as authentic, and this seems to me the most important point.<a id="calibre_link-357" href="#calibre_link-1790" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">10</sup></a></div>
<div class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-2421" class="calibre2"></a></div>
<h1 class="fmh1">
THE COMMENTARIES</h1>
<div class="fmtx">An invaluable aid to the understanding of the Pali Canon is provided by the old Commentaries (<i class="calibre9">Aṭṭhakathā</i>)<i class="calibre9">.</i> These need to be used with caution, and they certainly contain numerous pious fabrications. Without them, however, our understanding of the Suttas would be woefully deficient. The two chief commentaries have been published in Pali by the Pali Text Society. The earliest is called <i class="calibre9">Sumangalavilāsinī</i> (‘Effulgence of the Great Blessing’), but is usually known more prosaically as the Digha Nikāya Commentary (<i class="calibre9">Dīghanikāy-aṭṭhakathā</i> or DA, 3 volumes, 1886-1932, reprinted 1971). This is by the great Buddhaghosa, who lived in the 5th century C.E. The second, or Sub-Commentary (<i class="calibre9">ṭīkā</i>)<i class="calibre9">,</i> called <i class="calibre9">Dīghanikāy-aṭṭhakathā-ṭīkā-Līnatthavaṇṇnanā</i>  ‘Explanation of Obscurities in the Digha-Nikaya Commentary’ or DAT for short (3 vols., ed. Lily de Silva, 1970), is a commentary on the commentary. Extensive extracts from these two commentaries on Suttas 1 and 15 (with further passages from a third, called the ‘New Sub-Commentary’) are given by Bhikkhu Bodhi in his separate translations of those Suttas, and similar extracts are given by Soma Thera in his version of Sutta 22. Some scanty comments are also quoted (sometimes without translation!) by Rhys Davids at intervals. I have added a few more extracts in my notes where it seemed necessary, besides occasionally clarifying or correcting Rhys Davids’s notes.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Buddhaghosa was an Indian scholar-monk of amazing erudition who spent many years in Sri Lanka, where he wrote <i class="calibre9">The Path of Purification (Visuddhimagga)</i>, a comprehensive guide to doctrine and meditation, splendidly translated into English by the Ven. Ñāṇamoli and published by the Buddhist Publication Society, Sri Lanka (1956+). His version is a great improvement on the older one published by the Pali Text Society as <i class="calibre9">The Path of Purity.</i> It appears that the old commentaries on the Pali Canon, some of which seem to have been very ancient, were translated into Sinhalese and the Pali originals lost, and that Buddhaghosa made from these a new Pali version. In general it is clear that he is recording traditional opinions and interpretations, holding back, except on rare occasions, from expressing a personal opinion with admirable self-effacement. It is to be expected that in due course the major commentaries will be translated into English from their rather difficult late Pali language.</div>

THE DIVISIONS OF THE PALI CANON</h1>
<div class="fmtx">The Pali Canon is divided into three main sections (<i class="calibre9">Tipitaka</i>: the Three Baskets).</div>
<h2 class="fmh1">
1. <i class="calibre10">Vinaya Pitaka</i> </h2>
<div class="fmtx">This deals with monastic discipline, for monks and nuns. Translated by I.B. Horner as <i class="calibre9">The Book of Discipline</i> (6 volumes, PTS 1938-66).</div>
<h2 class="fmh1">
2. <i class="calibre10">Sutta Pitaka</i> </h2>
<div class="fmtx">The ‘Discourses’ (<i class="calibre9">Suttas</i>): the portion of the Canon of most interest to lay Buddhists (see below).</div>
<h2 class="fmh1">
3. <i class="calibre10">Abhidhamma Piṭaka</i> </h2>
<div class="fmtx">The ‘further doctrine’, a highly schematised philosophical compendium in seven books, most of which have now been translated into English by the PTS.</div>
<div class="calibre3">&nbsp;<br class="calibre3" /></div><div class="calibre3">&nbsp;<br class="calibre3" /></div><div class="calibre3">&nbsp;<br class="calibre3" /></div><div class="fmtx">The <i class="calibre9">Sutta Piṭaka</i> consists of five collections <i class="calibre9">(nikāyas).</i> The present translation is a new version of the first of these.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">(1) <i class="calibre9">Dīgha Nikāya</i> (‘long collection’, i.e. collection of long discourses). Translated by T.W. and C.A.F. Rhys Davids (SBB, 3 volumes, 1899-1921) as ‘Dialogues of the Buddha’. The Pali text (ed. T.W. Rhys Davids and J.E. Carpenter, PTS, 3 volumes, 1890-1910) is referred to here as D, the translation as RD (see Note on References).</div>
<div class="fmtx1">(2) <i class="calibre9">Majjhima Nikāya</i> (‘medium collection’). <i class="calibre9">The Teachings of the Buddha: The Middle Length Discourses of Buddha: A New Translation of the Majjhima Nika͂ya.</i> Original translation by Bhikkhu Ñānamoli, edited and revised by Bhikkhu Bodhi, Boston 1995. [MN]</div>
<div class="fmtx1">(3) <i class="calibre9">Saṁyutta Nikāya</i> (‘collection of groups’, i.e. according to subject-matter). Translated by C.A.F. Rhys Davids and F.L. Woodward (PTS, 5 volumes, 1917-30) as ‘Kindred Sayings’. [SN]</div>
<div class="fmtx1">(4) <i class="calibre9">Anguttara Nikāya</i> (‘collection of expanding groups’, i.e. single things, twos, threes, and so on up to elevens). Translated by F.L. Woodward and E.M. Hare (PTS, 5 volumes, 1932-36) as ‘Gradual Sayings’. [AN]</div>

<div class="fmtx1">(ii) <i class="calibre9">Dhammapada</i> (‘verses on Dhamma’), one of the most famous of Buddhist scriptures, an anthology in 26 chapters and  423 stanzas. Of the more than 30 English translations, the prose version by Narada Thera (various editions, including one by Murray, London 1972) is recommended for the serious student. The Penguin translation by J. Mascaró, though very readable, is marred by serious errors of interpretation. [Dhp]</div>

<h1 class="fmh1">
DIVISION ONE: THE MORALITIES</h1>
<div class="fmtx">1. <i class="calibre9">Brahmajāla</i> Sutta: The Supreme Net (What the Teaching is Not). The monks observe the wanderer Suppiya arguing with his pupil about the merits of the Buddha, his doctrine (<i class="calibre9">Dhamma</i>  ) and the order (<i class="calibre9">Sangha</i>)<i class="calibre9">.</i> The Buddha tells them not to be affected by either praise or blame of the teaching, and declares that the ‘worldling’ will praise him for superficial reasons and not for the essence of his teaching. He lists sixty-two different types of wrong view, all of which are based on contact of the six sense-bases and their objects. Contact conditions craving, which in turn leads to clinging, to (re)becoming, to birth, to ageing and death and all manner of suffering. But the Tathāgata (the Buddha) has gone beyond these things, and all sixty-two wrong views are trapped in his net.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2. <i class="calibre9">Sāmaññaphala Sutta:</i> The Fruits of the Homeless Life. King Ajātasattu of Magadha, who gained the throne by parricide, comes to the Buddha with a question he has already posed in vain to six rival ‘philosophers’: What are the fruits, visible here and now (in this life) of the life of renunciation? The Buddha tells him, and then goes on to speak of the higher benefits, the various meditative states, and finally true liberation (this section recurs in the next eleven Suttas). The King, deeply impressed, declares himself a lay-follower. The Buddha later tells his disciples that but for his crime Ajātasattu would have become a Stream-winner by the ‘opening of the Dhamma-eye’.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">3. <i class="calibre9">Ambaṭṭha Sutta:</i> About Ambattha (Pride Humbled). Pokkharasati, a famous Brahmin teacher, sends his pupil Ambattha (supposedly fully trained in Brahmin lore) to find out if the  ‘ascetic Gotama’ is the great man he is alleged to be (and if, therefore, he bears the ‘thirty-two marks of a Great Man’), Ambattha, proud of his Brahmin birth, behaves stupidly and arrogantly towards the Buddha, and thereupon learns a thing or two about his own ancestry, besides being made to realise that the Khattiyas (the warrior-noble caste) are superior to the Brahmins. Humbled, he returns to Pokkharasati, who is furious at his conduct, hastens to see the Buddha, learns that he does indeed bear the thirty-two marks, and becomes a convert.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">4. <i class="calibre9">Sonadaṇḍa Sutta:</i> About Sonadanda (Qualities of a True Brahmin). The Brahmin Sonadanda of Campa learns of the ascetic Gotama’s arrival and goes to see him, against the advice of other Brahmins who think it beneath his dignity. The Buddha asks him about the qualities of a true Brahmin. He mentions five, but at the Buddha’s instance admits that these can be reduced to two: wisdom and morality. He becomes a convert but does not experience the ‘opening of the Dhamma-eye’.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">5. <i class="calibre9">Kūṭadanta Sutta:</i> About Kūṭadanta (A Bloodless Sacrifice). The Brahmin Kūṭadanta wants to hold a great sacrifice with the slaughter of many hundreds of beasts. He appeals (improbably, as Rhys Davids points out!) to the Buddha for advice on how to do this. The Buddha tells him the story of an ancient king and his Brahmin chaplain, who performed a purely symbolic, bloodless sacrifice. Kūṭadanta sits in silence at the end of this narrative, having realised that the Buddha did not say: ‘I have heard this’, and the Buddha confirms that it is a story from one of his past lives, thus technically a ‘birth-story’ (<i class="calibre9">Jātaka</i>). The Buddha then tells of ‘sacrifices more profitable’, that is, the higher benefits as in Sutta 2. Kūṭadanta liberates the hundreds of animals he had destined for slaughter, saying: ‘Let them be fed with green grass and given cool water to drink, and let cool breezes play upon them’. He becomes a lay-follower, and the ‘pure and spotless Dhamma-eye’ opens in him.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">6. <i class="calibre9">Mahāli Sutta</i>: About Mahali (Heavenly Sights, Soul and Body). Otthaddha (surnamed Mahali) the Licchavi enquires of the Buddha about why some people cannot hear ‘heavenly sounds’ and so on, which the Buddha explains as due to their practice of ‘one-sided samadhi’. In the latter part, the Buddha  tells how two ascetics, Mandissa and Jāliya, had asked him whether the soul, or life principle, is the same as the body, or different (this is one of the ‘unanswered questions’ mentioned in Sutta 9). The Buddha says anyone who has attained to higher states of understanding will no longer be bothered by such questions.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">7. <i class="calibre9">Jāliya Sutta:</i> About Jaliya merely repeats the last part of Sutta 6.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">8. <i class="calibre9">Mahāsīhanāda Sutta</i>: The Great Lion’s Roar is also called ‘The Lion’s Roar to Kassapa’. The naked ascetic Kassapa asks if it is true that the Buddha condemns all forms of austerity. The Buddha denies this, saying one must distinguish. Kassapa gives a list of standard practices (some of them rather revolting), and the Buddha says one may do any of these things but, if one’s morality, heart and wisdom are not developed, one is still far from being an ascetic or a Brahmin (in the true sense). He himself has practised all possible austerities to perfection, and morality and wisdom as well. Kassapa requests ordination, and soon through diligent practice he becomes an Arahant.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">9. <i class="calibre9">Poṭṭhapāda Sutta</i>: About Potthapada (States of Consciousness). The ascetic Potthapada tells the Buddha that he and his fellows have been debating about ‘the higher extinction of consciousness’, and seeks a ruling on the matter. The Buddha says those who think mental states arise and pass away by chance are quite wrong. He lists the various jhana states, showing how perception can be ‘controlled’. Potthapada says he has never heard anything like all this before. The discussion moves to various kinds of possible self, all of which the Buddha refutes, and to the ‘unanswered questions’ and the reason for their not being answered. Citta, son of an elephant-trainer, joins in the discussion, and finally, while Potthapada becomes a lay-follower, Citta becomes a bhikkhu and soon gains Arahantship. In this Sutta we first find the parable of the man who said he was in love with the most beautiful girl in the country, without knowing who she was or what she looked like.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">10. <i class="calibre9">Subha Sutta:</i> About Subha (Morality, Concentration, Wisdom). Shortly after the Buddha’s death, Ananda explains the Ariyan morality, concentration and wisdom (as in Sutta 2) to the young Brahmin Subha, who becomes a lay-follower.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">11. <i class="calibre9">Kevaddha Sutta:</i> About Kevaddha (What Brahma Didn’t Know). Kevaddha urges the Buddha to perform miracles to strengthen people’s faith. The Buddha refuses, saying the only kind of miracle he approves of is the ‘miracle of instruction’. He tells the story of the monk who wanted to know ‘where the four great elements cease without remainder’. By psychic power he ascended into the heavens, but none there could tell him &mdash; not even the Great Brahma, who referred him back to the Buddha for an answer.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">12. <i class="calibre9">Lohicca Sutta:</i> About Lohicca (Good and Bad Teachers). Lohicca has the pernicious view that if anyone were to discover some new doctrine, he should keep it to himself. The Buddha puts him right and explains the difference between good and bad teachers.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">13. <i class="calibre9">Tevijja Sutta:</i> The Threefold Knowledge (The Way to Brahma). Two young Brahmins are puzzled because different teachers speak of different ways of attaining fellowship (or union) with Brahma, which to them is the highest goal. The Buddha gets them to admit that none of their teachers, or even those from whom the tradition stems, have ever seen Brahma face to face, then instructs them in the <i class="calibre9">Brahmavihāras,</i> which do lead to that goal &mdash; which is not, of course, the goal of Buddhism.</div>
<div class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-2425" class="calibre2"></a></div>
<h1 class="fmh1">
DIVISION TWO: THE GREAT DIVISION</h1>
<div class="fmtx">14. <i class="calibre9">Mahâpadāna Sutta:</i> The Great Discourse on the Lineage. This refers to the last seven Buddhas, going back ‘ninety-one aeons’ in time. The life of the Buddha Vipassi at that remote period is told in terms similar to early versions of the life of Gotama. All Buddhas go through the same experiences in their last earthly life. The Buddha’s realisation is equated with the understanding of dependent origination (see next Sutta).</div>
<div class="fmtx1">15. <i class="calibre9">Mahānidāna Sutta:</i> The Great Discourse on Origination. Ānanda is rebuked for saying the law of dependent origination is ‘as clear as clear’ to him. The Buddha explains it in reverse order first, but going back only to mind-and-body and consciousness (that is, factors 4 and 3 of the usual list of 12), and also omitting the six sense-bases (No 5). The exposition ends  with a reference to the seven stages of consciousness and the two realms.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">16. <i class="calibre9">Mahāparinibbā̄na Sutta:</i> The Great Passing (The Buddha’s Last Days). The longest Sutta of all, telling (not without some legendary embroidery) the story of the Buddha’s last days. King Ajātasattu, wishing to attack the Vajjians, sends to the Buddha to know what the outcome will be. The Buddha replies indirectly, pointing out the advantages of the Vajjian republican system, and later urges the monks to observe comparable rules for the Sangha. With Ananda, he visits a series of places and gives discourses to monks and laity. At Pāṭaligā̄ma he prophesies the place’s future greatness (it became Asoka’s capital Pāṭaliputra). At Vesāli the courtesan Ambapā̄li invites him to a meal, and gives her mango-grove to the order. He tells Ananda that he will pass away within three months. At Pā̄vā̄ Cunda the smith serves a meal including ‘pig’s delight’ <i class="calibre9">(sūkara-maddava)</i> (pork, truffles?-opinions vary) which only the Buddha eats. Later he is taken very ill, but is careful to exonerate Cunda. At Kusinā̄ra the Buddha rests between twin <i class="calibre9">sā̄l-</i>trees<i class="calibre9">.</i> Ananda begs him not to pass away in such an insignificant place, but he says it was once a famous capital (see Sutta 17). After giving last instructions to the Sangha (and refusing to appoint a successor), he utters the final admonition ‘strive on untiringly’ - <i class="calibre9">appamādena sampādetha &mdash; </i> and passes away. The Sutta concludes with an account of the funeral and distribution of the ashes in eight portions.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">17. <i class="calibre9">Mahāsudassana Sutta</i>: The Great Splendour (A King’s Renunciation). Much the same story recurs in Jātaka 95. King Mahāsudassana lived in fairy-tale splendour and possessed the seven treasures, but finally retired to his Dhamma palace (built by the gods) to lead a life of meditation.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">18. <i class="calibre9">Janavasabha Sutta:</i> About Janavasabha (Brahmā Addresses the Gods). A yakkha (of the good variety) appears to the Buddha declaring that he is now called Janavasabha, but on earth was King Bimbisāra of Magadha, the Buddha’s great supporter, killed by his son Ajātasattu. He tells of the assembly of the Thirty-Three Gods at which Brahmā declared how, since the Buddha’s mission on earth, the ranks of the gods (devas) are increasing and those of their opponents the asuras, declining.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">19. <i class="calibre9">Mahāgovinda Sutta:</i> The Great Steward (A Past Life of Gotama). The gandhabba Pan͂casikha appears to the Buddha and reports, similarly to Sutta 18, on a meeting of the gods. Then follows the story of the Great Steward who conducted the affairs of seven kings and then retired into the homeless life, bringing many people to the Brahmā-world which is the highest people can reach in an age when there is no Buddha. At the end the Buddha tells Pan͂casikha that he was that steward, but that the path he now teaches, as the Buddha, goes beyond what he was able to teach then.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">20. <i class="calibre9">Mahāsamaya Sutta:</i> The Mighty Gathering (Devas Come to See the Buddha). A Sutta practically all in verse giving much mythological lore.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">21. <i class="calibre9">Sakkapan͂ha Sutta:</i> Sakka’s Questions (A God Consults the Buddha). Sakka, king of the Thirty-Three Gods, approaches the Buddha through the aid of Pan͂casikha, who sings a love-song (!) to him to attract his attention. Sakka puts various questions on the holy life to the Buddha. We also hear the story of the nun Gopika who became a man, and as such rebuked three of the Buddha’s monks who had been reborn in the lowest of the heavens, bidding them strive harder and rise higher, which two of them succeeded in doing. Sakka himself is put on the right path and rewards Pan͂casikha (who is not so advanced!) with the hand of the gandhabba maiden he desired.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">22. <i class="calibre9">Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna Sutta:</i> The Greater Discourse on the Foundations of Mindfulness. Very different in character from the Suttas immediately preceding, this is held by many to be the most important Sutta in the Canon. It recurs verbatim less verses 18 &mdash; 21, as No 10 in the Majjhima Nikaya. The ‘one way’ for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and distress, for the gaining of Nibbāna is the four foundations of mindfulness: mindfulness of body, feelings, mind and mind-objects. Detailed instructions for mindful awareness of breathing, and so on, are given. Thus, under mind-objects, we read, for example: ‘If sensual desire is present in himself, a monk knows that it is present. If sensual desire is absent in himself, a monk knows that it is absent. And he knows how unarisen sensual desire comes to arise, and he knows how the abandonment of arisen sensual desire comes about, and he knows how  the non-arising of the abandoned sensual desire in the future will come about.’ (‘Monk’ here, according to the Commentary, means anyone who does the practice). The Sutta ends with an account of the Four Noble Truths.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">23. <i class="calibre9">Pāyāsi Sutta:</i> About Pāyāsi (Debate with a Sceptic). Prince Pāyāsi does not believe in future lives, or in the rewards and penalties of good and bad deeds. The Ven. Kumāra-Kassapa convinces him of his error by means of a series of clever parables. Finally Pāyāsi, converted, establishes a charity for ascetics and the needy, but does so grudgingly. As a result he is reborn in the lowest of the heavens.</div>
<div class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-2426" class="calibre2"></a></div>
<h1 class="fmh1">
DIVISION THREE: THE ‘PĀṬIKA’ DIVISION</h1>
<div class="fmtx">24. <i class="calibre9">Pāṭika Sutta:</i> About Pāṭikaputta (The Charlatan). The Buddha has an exceedingly stupid disciple Sunakkhatta, who eventually leaves him. Sunakkhatta is greatly impressed by some dubious ‘holy men’ whom he takes to be Arahants. The boastful naked ascetic Pāṭikaputta challenges the Buddha to a contest of miracles. The Buddha waits for him to appear, but &mdash; as the Buddha prophesied &mdash; he cannot even rise from his seat to meet the Buddha. The Sutta is not unamusing, but definitely substandard material. A final section on the ‘Origin of Things’ seems to have been tacked on.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">25. <i class="calibre9">Udumbarika-Sï̄hanāda Sutta:</i> The Lion’s Roar to the Udumbarikans. The wanderer Nigrodha, staying at the Udumbarika lodging, boasts that he can ‘floor the ascetic Gotama’ with a single question. He is of course defeated, and the Buddha shows a way beyond that of self-mortification - ‘to reach the pith’.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">26. <i class="calibre9">Cakkavatti-Sīhanā̄da Sutta:</i> The Lion’s Roar on the Turning of the Wheel. At the beginning and end of the discourse, the Buddha exhorts his monks to ‘keep to their own preserves’ by the practice of mindfulness. Then he tells of a ‘wheel-turning monarch’ (a righteous ruler) who had the sacred Wheel-Treasure, which had to be carefully guarded. He was followed by a line of righteous kings, but. eventually they degenerated, and society went from bad to worse, while the human life-span  sank to ten years and all sense of morality was lost. After a brief but dreadful ‘sword-interval’ things improved, and finally another Buddha, Metteyya (Sanskrit Maitreya) will appear.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">27. <i class="calibre9">Aggan͂n͂a Sutta:</i> On Knowledge of Beginnings. A somewhat similar fable, this time addressed to the Brahmins, whose pretensions the Buddha refutes. There is no difference between Brahmins and others if they behave badly. A somewhat fanciful account of the origin of castes is given.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">28. <i class="calibre9">Sampasādanīya Sutta:</i> Serene Faith. Sāriputta explains his reasons for his complete faith in the Buddha.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">29. <i class="calibre9">Pāsā̄dika Sutta:</i> The Delightful Discourse. A discussion of good and bad teachers, and why the Buddha has not revealed certain points.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">30. <i class="calibre9">Lakkhaṇa Sutta:</i> The Marks of a Great Man. Verses on the curious ‘thirty-two marks of a Great Man’ beloved of the Brahmins. These are in a variety of metres in the original.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">31. <i class="calibre9">Sigā̄laka Sutta:</i> To Sigā̄laka (Advice to Lay People). Advice to the young layman Sigālaka on morality, related to the four quarters, zenith and nadir which, in memory of his father, he had been worshipping.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">32. <i class="calibre9">Āṭā̄nā̄ṭiya Sutta:</i> The Āṭā̄nāṭā Protective verses.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">33. <i class="calibre9">Sangīti Sutta:</i> The Chanting Together (Lists of terms for recitation).</div>
<div class="fmtx1">34. <i class="calibre9">Dasuttara Sutta:</i> Expanding Decades. Similar material to Sutta 33, arranged under ten heads.</div>

<div class="cst"><b class="calibre5">What the Teaching Is Not</b></div>
<div class="fmtx">[1] 1.1. THUS HAVE I HEARD.<a id="calibre_link-358" href="#calibre_link-1672" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">11</sup></a> Once the Lord was travelling along the main road between Rājagaha and Nāḷandā<a id="calibre_link-359" href="#calibre_link-1673" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">12</sup></a> with a large company of some five hundred monks. And the wanderer Suppiya was also travelling on that road with his pupil the youth Brahmadatta. And Suppiya <a id="calibre_link-360" href="#calibre_link-1674" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">13</sup></a> was finding fault in all sorts of ways with the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, whereas his pupil Brahmadatta was speaking in various ways in their praise. And so these two, teacher and pupil, directly opposing each other’s arguments, followed close behind the Lord and his order of monks.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.2. Then the Lord stopped for one night with his monks at the royal park of Ambalaṭṭhikā. And Suppiya too stopped there for the night with his pupil Brahmadatta. And Suppiya went on abusing the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, while his [2] pupil Brahmadatta defended them. And thus disputing, they followed close behind the Buddha and his order of monks.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.3. Now in the early morning a number of monks, having got up, gathered together and sat in the Round Pavilion, and this was the trend of their talk: ‘It is wonderful, friends, it is marvellous how the Blessed Lord, the Arahant, the fully-enlightened Buddha knows, sees and clearly distinguishes the different inclinations of beings! For here is the wanderer Suppiya finding fault in all sorts of ways with the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, while his pupil Brahmadatta in various ways defends them. And, still disputing, they follow closely behind the Blessed Lord and his order of monks.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.4. Then the Lord, being aware of what those monks were saying, went to the Round Pavilion and sat down on the prepared  seat. Then he said: ‘Monks, what was the subject of your conversation just now? What talk have I interrupted?’ And they told him.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.5. ‘Monks, if anyone should speak in disparagement of me, of the Dhamma or of the Sangha, [3] you should not be angry, resentful or upset on that account. If you were to be angry or displeased at such disparagement, that would only be a hindrance to you. For if others disparage me, the Dhamma or the Sangha, and you are angry or displeased, can you recognise whether what they say is right or not?’ ‘No, Lord.’ ‘If others disparage me, the Dhamma or the Sangha, then you must explain what is incorrect as being incorrect, saying: “That is incorrect, that is false, that is not our way,<a id="calibre_link-361" href="#calibre_link-1675" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">14</sup></a> that is not found among us.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.6. ‘But, monks, if others should speak in praise of me, of the Dhamma or of the Sangha, you should not on that account be pleased, happy or elated.

<div class="fmtx">[47] 1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. Once the Lord was staying at Rājagaha, in Jivaka Komārabhacca’s<a id="calibre_link-438" href="#calibre_link-1445" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">91</sup></a> mango-grove, together with a large company of some twelve hundred and fifty monks. And at that time King Ajatasattu Vedehiputta<a id="calibre_link-439" href="#calibre_link-1446" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">92</sup></a> of Magadha, having gone up to the roof of his palace, was sitting there surrounded by his ministers, on the fifteenth-day fast-day,<a id="calibre_link-440" href="#calibre_link-1447" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">93</sup></a> the full-moon of the fourth month,<a id="calibre_link-441" href="#calibre_link-1448" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">94</sup></a> called Komudi.<a id="calibre_link-442" href="#calibre_link-1449" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">95</sup></a> And King Ajatasattu, on that fast-day, gave vent to this solemn utterance: ‘Delightful, friends, is this moonlight night! Charming is this moonlight night! Auspicious is this moonlight night! Can we not today visit some ascetic or Brahmin, to visit whom would bring peace to our heart?’<a id="calibre_link-443" href="#calibre_link-1450" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">96</sup></a></div>
<div class="fmtx1">2. Then one minister said to King Ajatasattu: ‘Sire, there is Pūraṇa Kassapa, who has many followers, a teacher of many, who is well-known, renowned, the founder of a sect, highly honoured by the multitude, of long standing, long-since gone forth, aged and venerable. May Your Majesty visit this Pūraṇa Kassapa. He may well bring peace to Your Majesty’s heart.’ At these words King Ajatasattu was silent.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">3. Another minister said: ‘Sire, there is [48] Makkhali Gosala, who has many followers ... He may well bring peace to your Majesty’s heart.’ At these words King Ajatasattu was silent.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">4. Another minister said: ‘Sire, there is Ajita Kesakambali ...’ At these words King Ajatasattu was silent.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">5. Another minister said: ‘Sire, there is Pakudha Kaccayana ...’ At these words King Ajātasattu was silent.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">6. Another minister said: ‘Sire, there is Sañjaya Belatthaputta...’ At these words King Ajātasattu was silent.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">7. Another minister said: ‘Sire, there is [49] the Nigantha  Nataputta, who has many followers, a teacher of many, who is well-known, ... aged and venerable. May Your Majesty visit the Nigantha Nataputta. He may well bring peace to Your Majesty’s heart.’ At these words King Ajatasattu was silent.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">8. All this time Jivaka Komarabhacca was sitting silently near King Ajatasattu. The King said to him: ‘You, friend Jivaka, why are you silent?’ ‘Sire, there is this Blessed Lord, the Arahant, the fully-enlightened Buddha staying in my mango-grove with a large company of some twelve hundred and fifty monks. And concerning the Blessed Gotama this fair report has been spread about: “This Blessed Lord is an Arahant, a fully-enlightened Buddha, endowed with wisdom and conduct, the Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed,<a id="calibre_link-444" href="#calibre_link-1451" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">97</sup></a> Teacher of gods and humans, enlightened and blessed.” May Your Majesty visit the Blessed Lord. He may well bring peace to Your Majesty’s heart.’ ‘Then, Jivaka, have the riding-elephants made ready.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">9. ‘Very good, Sire’, said Jivaka, and he had five hundred she-elephants made ready, and for the King the royal tusker. Then he reported: ‘Sire, the riding-elephants are ready. Now is the time to do as Your Majesty wishes.’ And King Ajātasattu, having placed his wives each on one of the five hundred she-elephants, mounted the royal tusker and proceeded in royal state, accompanied by torch-bearers, from Rajagaha towards Jīvaka’s mango-grove.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">10. And when King Ajatasattu came near the mango-grove he felt fear and terror, and his hair stood on end. And feeling [50] this fear and the rising of the hairs, the King said to Jīvaka: ‘Friend Jivaka, you are not deceiving me? You are not tricking me? You are not delivering me up to an enemy? How is it that from this great number of twelve hundred and fifty monks not a sneeze, a cough or a shout is to be heard?’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Have no fear, Your Majesty, I would not deceive you or trick you or deliver you up to an enemy. Approach, Sire, approach. There are the lights burning in the round pavilion.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">11. So King Ajatasattu, having ridden on his elephant as far as the ground would permit, alighted and continued on foot to the door of the round pavilion. Then he said: ‘Jivaka, where  is the Lord?’ ‘That is the Lord, Sire. That is the Lord sitting against the middle column with his order of monks in front of him.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">12. Then King Ajātasattu went up to the Lord and stood to one side, and standing there to one side the King observed how the order of monks continued in silence like a clear lake, and he exclaimed: ‘If only Prince Udāyabhadda were possessed of such calm as this order of monks!’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Do your thoughts go to the one you love, Your Majesty?’ ‘Lord, Prince Udāyabhadda<a id="calibre_link-445" href="#calibre_link-1452" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">98</sup></a> is very dear to me. If only he were possessed of the same calm as this order of monks!’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">13. Then King Ajātasattu, having bowed down to the Lord and saluted the order of monks with [51] joined hands, sat down to one side and said: ‘Lord, I would ask something, if the Lord would deign to answer me.’ ‘Ask, Your Majesty, anything you like.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">14. ‘Lord, just as there are these various craftsmen, such as elephant-drivers, horse-drivers, chariot-fighters, archers, standard-bearers, adjutants, army caterers, champions and senior officers, scouts, heroes, brave fighters, cuirassiers, slaves’ sons, cooks, barbers, bathmen, bakers, garland-makers, bleachers, weavers, basket-makers, potters, calculators and accountants &mdash; and whatever other skills there are: they enjoy here and now the visible fruits of their skills, they themselves are delighted and pleased with this, as are their parents, children and colleagues and friends, they maintain and support ascetics and Brahmins, thus assuring for themselves a heavenly, happy reward tending towards paradise. Can you, Lord, point to such a reward visible here and now as a fruit of the homeless life?’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">15. ‘Your Majesty, do you admit that you have put this question to other ascetics and Brahmins?’ ‘I admit it, Lord.’ ‘Would Your Majesty mind saying how they replied?’ ‘I do not mind telling the Lord, or one like him.’ [52] ‘Well then, Your Majesty, tell me.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">16. ‘Once, Lord, I went to see Pūraṇa Kassapa.<a id="calibre_link-446" href="#calibre_link-1453" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">99</sup></a> Having exchanged courtesies, I sat down to one side and said: “Good Kassapa, just as there are these various craftsmen, ... they enjoy  here and now the visible fruits of their skills ... (<i class="calibre9">as verse 14</i>). Can you, Kassapa, point to such a reward visible here and now as a fruit of the homeless life?”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">17. ‘At this, Lord, Pūraṇa Kassapa said: “Your Majesty, by the doer or instigator of a thing, by one who cuts or causes to be cut, by one who burns or causes to be burnt, by one who causes grief and weariness, by one who agitates or causes agitation, who causes life to be taken or that which is not given to be taken, commits burglary, carries off booty, commits robbery, lies in ambush, commits adultery and tells lies, no evil is done. If with a razor-sharp wheel one were to make of this earth one single mass and heap of flesh, there would be no evil as a result of that, no evil would accrue. If one were to go along the south bank of the Ganges killing, slaying, cutting or causing to be cut, burning or causing to be burnt, there would be no evil as a result of that, no evil would accrue. Or if one were to go along the north bank of the Ganges giving and causing to be given, sacrificing and causing to be sacrificed, there would be no merit as a result of that, no merit would accrue. [53] In giving, self-control, abstinence and telling the truth, there is no merit, and no merit accrues.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">18. ‘Thus, Lord, Pūraṇa Kassapa, on being asked about the present fruits of the homeless life, explained non-action to me. Just as if on being asked about a mango he were to describe a breadfruit-tree, or on being asked about a breadfruit-tree he were to describe a mango, so Pūraṇa Kassapa, on being asked about the present fruits of the homeless life, explained non-action to me. And, Lord, I thought: “How should one like me think despitefully of any ascetic or Brahmin dwelling in my territory?”<a id="calibre_link-447" href="#calibre_link-1454" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">100</sup></a> so I neither applauded nor rejected Pūraṇa Kassapa’s words but, though displeased, not expressing my displeasure, saying nothing, rejecting and scorning speech, I got up and left.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">19. ‘Once I visited Makkhali Gosāla,<a id="calibre_link-448" href="#calibre_link-1455" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">101</sup></a> and asked him the same question.</div>

There is no cause or condition for the purification of beings, they are purified without cause or  condition. There is no self-power or other-power, there is no power in humans, no strength or force, no vigour or exertion. All beings, all living things, all creatures, all that lives is without control, without power or strength, they experience the fixed course of pleasure and pain through the six kinds of rebirth. There [54] are one million four hundred thousand principal sorts of birth, and six thousand others and again six hundred. There are five hundred kinds of kamma,<a id="calibre_link-450" href="#calibre_link-1457" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">103</sup></a> or five kinds,<a id="calibre_link-451" href="#calibre_link-1458" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">104</sup></a> and three kinds,<a id="calibre_link-452" href="#calibre_link-1459" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">105</sup></a> and half-kamma, <a id="calibre_link-453" href="#calibre_link-1460" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">106</sup></a> sixty-two paths, sixty-two intermediary aeons, six classes of humankind, eight stages of human progress, four thousand nine hundred occupations, four thousand nine hundred wanderers, four thousand nine hundred abodes of nagas,<a id="calibre_link-454" href="#calibre_link-1461" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">107</sup></a> two thousand sentient existences, three thousand hells, thirty-six places of dust, seven classes of rebirth as conscious beings, seven as unconscious beings, and seven as beings ‘freed from bonds’,<a id="calibre_link-455" href="#calibre_link-1462" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">108</sup></a>  seven grades of devas, men, goblins, seven lakes, seven great and seven small protuberances,<a id="calibre_link-456" href="#calibre_link-1463" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">109</sup></a> seven great and seven small abysses, seven great and seven small dreams, eight million four hundred thousand aeons during which fools and wise run on and circle round till they make an end of suffering.</div>

<div class="fmtx1">21. ‘Thus, Lord, Makkhali Gosala, on being asked about the fruits of the homeless life, explained the purification of the round of birth-and-death to me... [55] So I neither applauded nor rejected Makkhali Gosala’s words but...got up and left.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">22. ‘Once I visited Ajita Kesakambalī<a id="calibre_link-458" href="#calibre_link-1465" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">111</sup></a> and asked him the same question.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">23. ‘Ajita Kesakambali said: “Your Majesty, there is nothing given, bestowed, offered in sacrifice, there is no fruit or result  of good or bad deeds, there is not this world or the next, there is no mother or father, there are no spontaneously arisen beings,<a id="calibre_link-459" href="#calibre_link-1466" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">112</sup></a> there are in the world no ascetics or Brahmins who have attained, who have perfectly practised, who proclaim this world and the next, having realised them by their own super-knowledge. This human being is composed of the four great elements, and when one dies the earth part reverts to earth, the water part to water, the fire part to fire, the air part to air, and the faculties pass away into space. They accompany the dead man with four bearers and the bier as fifth, their footsteps are heard as far as the cremation-ground. There the bones whiten, the sacrifice ends in ashes. It is the idea of a fool to give this gift: the talk of those who preach a doctrine of survival is vain and false. Fools and wise, at the breaking-up of the body, are destroyed and perish, they do not exist after death.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">24. ‘Thus, Lord, Ajita Kesakambali, on being asked about the fruits of the homeless life, explained the doctrine of annihilation to me ... [56] ... I got up and left.</div>

<div class="fmtx1">26. ‘Pakudha Kaccayana said: “Your Majesty, these seven things are not made or of a kind to be made, uncreated, unproductive, barren, false, stable as a column. They do not shake, do not change, obstruct one another, nor are they able to cause one another pleasure, pain, or both. What are the seven? The earth-body, the water-body, the fire-body, the air-body, pleasure and pain and the life-principle. These seven are not made...Thus there is neither slain nor slayer, neither hearer nor proclaimer, neither knower nor causer of knowing. And whoever cuts off a man’s head with a sharp sword does not deprive anyone of life, he just inserts the blade in the intervening space between these seven bodies.” [57]</div>
<div class="fmtx1">27. ‘Thus, Lord, Pakudha Kaccayana, on being asked about the fruits of the homeless life, answered with something quite different...I got up and left.</div>

And then if people were to announce to you: “Sire, you remember that slave who worked in your presence, and who shaved off his hair and beard and went forth into homelessness?

He preaches the Dhamma, which is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its middle, lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and displays the fully-perfected and purified holy life.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">41. ‘This Dhamma is heard by a householder or a householder’s son, or one reborn in some family or other. Having heard this Dhamma, [63] he gains faith in the Tathagata. Having gained this faith, he reflects: “The household life is close and dusty, the homeless life is free as air. It is not easy, living the household life, to live the fully-perfected holy life, purified and polished like a conch-shell. Suppose I were to shave off my hair and beard, don yellow robes and go forth from the household life into homelessness!” And after some time, he abandons his property, small or great, leaves his circle of relatives, small or great, shaves off his hair and beard, dons yellow robes and goes forth into the homeless life.</div>

<div class="fmtx1">43. &mdash; 62. ‘And how, Sire, is a monk perfected in morality? Abandoning the taking of life, he dwells refraining from taking life, without stick or sword, scrupulous, compassionate,  trembling for the welfare of all living beings. Thus he is accomplished in morality. Abandoning the taking of what is not given,... abandoning unchastity,... (<i class="calibre9">and so on through the three sections on morality as Sutta 1</i>, <i class="calibre9">verses 1.8 &mdash; 27</i>). A monk refrains from such base arts and wrong means of livelihood. Thus he is perfected in morality. [64 &mdash; 69]</div>
<div class="fmtx1">63. ‘And then, Sire, that monk who is perfected in morality sees no danger from any side owing to his being restrained by morality. Just as a duly-anointed Khattiya king, having conquered [70] his enemies, by that very fact sees no danger from any side, so the monk, on account of his morality, sees no danger anywhere. He experiences in himself the blameless bliss that comes from maintaining this Ariyan morality. In this way, Sire, he is perfected in morality.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">64. ‘And how, Sire, is he a guardian of the sense-doors? Here a monk, on seeing a visible object with the eye, does not grasp at its major signs or secondary characteristics. Because greed and sorrow, evil unskilled states, would overwhelm him if he dwelt leaving this eye-faculty unguarded, so he practises guarding it, he protects the eye-faculty, develops restraint of the eye-faculty. On hearing a sound with the ear, ... on smelling an odour with the nose, ... on tasting a flavour with the tongue,...on feeling an object with the body,...on thinking a thought with the mind, he does not grasp at its major signs or secondary characteristics, ... he develops restraint of the mind-faculty.

<div class="fmtx1">65. ‘And how, Sire, is a monk accomplished in mindfulness and clear awareness?

In this way, [71] a monk is accomplished in mindfulness and clear awareness.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">66. ‘And how is a monk contented? Here, a monk is satisfied with a robe to protect his body, with alms to satisfy his stomach, and having accepted sufficient, he goes on his way.

Then, having eaten after his return from the alms-round, he sits down cross-legged, holding his body erect, and concentrates on keeping mindfulness established before him.<a id="calibre_link-466" href="#calibre_link-1473" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">119</sup></a></div>

<div class="fmtx">[87] 1.1 THUS HAVE I HEARD. Once the Lord was touring Kosala with a large number of monks, some five hundred, and he came to a Kosalan Brahmin village called Icchanankala. And he stayed in the dense jungle of Icchanankala. At that time the Brahmin Pokkharasati was living at Ukkhattha, a populous place, full of grass, timber, water and corn, which had been given to him by King Pasenadi of Kosala as a royal gift and with royal powers.<a id="calibre_link-488" href="#calibre_link-1645" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">141</sup></a></div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.2. And Pokkharasati heard say: ‘The ascetic Gotama, son of the Sakyans, who has gone forth from the Sakya clan,...is staying in the dense jungle of Icchanankala. And concerning that Blessed Lord a good report has been spread about: “This Blessed Lord is an Arahant, a fully-enlightened Buddha, perfected in knowledge and conduct, a Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, unequalled Trainer of men to be tamed, Teacher of gods and humans, a Buddha, a Blessed Lord.” He proclaims this world with its gods, maras, Brahmas, the world of ascetics and Brahmins with its princes and people, having come to know it by his own knowledge. He teaches a Dhamma that is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its middle, and lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and he displays the fully-perfected, thoroughly purified [88] holy life. And indeed it is good to see such Arahants.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.3. Now at that time Pokkharasāti had a pupil, the youth Ambattha, who was a student of the Vedas, who knew the mantras, perfected in the Three Vedas, a skilled expounder of the rules and rituals, the lore of sounds and meanings and, fifthly, oral tradition, complete in philosophy<a id="calibre_link-489" href="#calibre_link-1646" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">142</sup></a> and in the marks<a id="calibre_link-490" href="#calibre_link-1647" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">143</sup></a> of a Great Man, admitted and accepted by his master  in the Three Vedas with the words: ‘What I know, you know; what you know, I know.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.4. And Pokkharasati said to Ambattha: ‘Ambattha, my son, the ascetic Gotama ... is staying in the dense jungle of Icchānankala. And concerning that Blessed Lord a good report has been spread about ... Now you go to see the ascetic Gotama and find out whether this report is correct or not, and whether the Reverend Gotama is as they say or not. In that way we shall put the Reverend Gotama to the test.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.5. ‘Sir, how shall I find out whether the report is true, or whether the Reverend Gotama is as they say or not?’ ‘According to the tradition of our mantras, Ambattha, the great man who is possessed of the thirty-two marks of a Great Man has only two courses open to him. If he lives the household life he will become a ruler, a wheel-turning righteous monarch of the law,<a id="calibre_link-491" href="#calibre_link-1648" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">144</sup></a> conqueror of the four quarters, who has established the security of his realm and is possessed of the [89] seven treasures.<a id="calibre_link-492" href="#calibre_link-1649" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">145</sup></a> These are: the Wheel-Treasure, the Elephant-Treasure, the Horse-Treasure, the Jewel-Treasure, the Woman-Treasure, the Householder-Treasure, and, as seventh, the Counsellor-Treasure. He has more than a thousand sons who are heroes, of heroic stature, conquerors of the hostile army. He dwells having conquered this sea-girt land without stick or sword, by the law. But if he goes forth from the household life into homelessness, then he will become an Arahant, a fully-enlightened Buddha, one who draws back the veil from the world.<a id="calibre_link-493" href="#calibre_link-1650" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">146</sup></a> And, Ambattha, I am the passer-on of the mantras, and you are the receiver.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.6. ‘Very good, sir’, said Ambattha at Pokkharasāti’s words, and he got up, passed by Pokkharasati with his right side, got into his chariot drawn by a mare and, accompanied by a number of young men, headed for the dense jungle of Icchānankala. He drove as far as the carriage would go, then alighted and continued on foot.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.7. At that time a number of monks were walking up and down in the open air. Ambattha approached them and said: ‘Where is the Reverend Gotama to be found just now? We have come to see the Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.8. The monks thought: ‘This is Ambattha, a youth of good  family and a pupil of the distinguished Brahmin Pokkharasāti. The Lord would not mind having a conversation with such a young man.’ And they said to Ambattha: ‘That is his dwelling, with the door closed. Go quietly up to it, go on to the verandah without haste, cough, and knock on the bolt. The Lord will open the door to you.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.9. Ambattha went up to the dwelling and on to the verandah, coughed, and knocked. The Lord opened the door, and Ambaṭṭha went in. The young men entered, exchanged courtesies with the Lord, and sat down to one side. But Ambattha walked up and down while the Lord sat there, [90] uttered some vague words of politeness, and then stood so speaking before the seated Lord.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.10. And the Lord said to Ambattha: ‘Well now, Ambattha, would you behave like this if you were talking to venerable and learned Brahmins, teachers of teachers, as you do with me, walking and standing while I am sitting, and uttering vague words of politeness?’ ‘No, Reverend Gotama. A Brahmin should walk with a walking Brahmin, stand with a standing Brahmin, sit with a sitting Brahmin, and lie down with a Brahmin who is lying down. But as for those shaven little ascetics, menials, black scourings from Brahmā’s foot, with them it is fitting to speak just as I do with the Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.11. ‘But, Ambattha, you came here seeking something. Whatever it was you came for, you should listen attentively to hear about it. Ambattha, you have not perfected your training. Your conceit of being trained is due to nothing but inexperience.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.12. But Ambattha was angry and displeased at being called untrained, and he turned on the Lord with curses and insults. Thinking: ‘The ascetic Gotama bears me ill-will’, he said: ‘Reverend Gotama, the Sakyans are fierce, rough-spoken, touchy [91] and violent. Being of menial origin, being menials, they do not honour, respect, esteem, revere or pay homage to Brahmins. With regard to this it is not proper... that they do not pay homage to Brahmins.’ This was the first time Ambattha accused the Sakyans of being menials.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.13. ‘But, Ambattha, what have the Sakyans done to you?’  ‘Reverend Gotama, once I went to Kapilavatthu on some business for my teacher, the Brahmin Pokkharasāti, and I came to the Sakyans’ meeting-hall. And at that time a lot of Sakyans were sitting on high seats in their meeting-hall, poking each other with their fingers, laughing and playing about together, and it seemed to me that they were just making fun of me, and no one offered me a seat. With regard to this, it is not proper that they do not pay homage to the Brahmins.’ This was the second time Ambattha accused the Sakyans of being menials.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.14. ‘But Ambattha, even the quail, that little bird, can talk as she likes on her own nest. Kapilavatthu is the Sakyans’ home, Ambattha. They do not deserve censure for such a trifle.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Reverend Gotama, there are four castes:<a id="calibre_link-494" href="#calibre_link-1651" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">147</sup></a> the Khattiyas, the Brahmins, the merchants and the artisans. And of these four castes three &mdash; the Khattiyas, the merchants and the artisans &mdash; are entirely subservient to the Brahmins. With regard to this, [92] it is not proper that they should not pay homage to the Brahmins.’ This was the third time Ambattha accused the Sakyans of being menials.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.15. Then the Lord thought: ‘This young man goes too far in abusing the Sakyans. Suppose I were to ask after his clan-name? ’ So he said: ‘Ambattha, what is your clan?’ ‘I am a Kaṇhāyan, Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Ambattha, in former days, according to those who remember the ancestral lineage, the Sakyans were the masters, and you are descended from a slave-girl of the Sakyans. For the Sakyans regard King Okkāka as their ancestor. At one time King Okkāka, to whom his queen was dear and beloved, wishing to transfer the kingdom to her son, banished his elder brothers from the kingdom &mdash; Okkamukha, Karandu, Hatthiniya and Sinipura. And these, being banished, made their home on the flank of the Himālayas beside a lotus-pond where there was a big grove of teak-trees.<a id="calibre_link-495" href="#calibre_link-1652" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">148</sup></a> And for fear of contaminating the stock they cohabited with their own sisters. Then King Okkāka asked his ministers and counsellors: “Where are the princes living now?” and they told him. At this King Okkāha exclaimed: [93] “They are strong as teak  (<i class="calibre9">sāka</i>)<i class="calibre9">,</i> these princes, they are real Sakyans!”<a id="calibre_link-496" href="#calibre_link-1653" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">149</sup></a> And that is how the Sakyans got their well-known name. And the King was the ancestor of the Sakyans.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.16. ‘Now King Okkāka had a slave-girl called Disā, who gave birth to a black child. The black thing, when it was born, exclaimed: “Wash me, mother! Bath me, mother! Deliver me from this dirt, and I will bring you profit!” Because, Ambattha, just as people today use the term hobgoblin <i class="calibre9">(pisāca)</i> as a term of abuse, so in those days they said black (<i class="calibre9">kaṇha</i>)<i class="calibre9">.</i> And they said: “As soon as he was born, he spoke. He is born a Kanha, a hobgoblin!” That is how in former days...the Sakyans were the masters, and you are descended from a slave-girl of the Sakyans.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.17. On hearing this, the young men said: ‘Reverend Gotama, do not humiliate Ambattha too much with talk of his being descended from a slave-girl: Ambattha is well-born, of a good family, he is very learned, he is well-spoken, a scholar, well able to hold his own in this discussion with the Reverend Gotama!’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.18. Then the Lord said to the young men: ‘If you consider that Ambattha is ill-born, not of a good family, unlearned, [94] ill-spoken, no scholar, unable to hold his own in this discussion with the ascetic Gotama, then let Ambattha be silent, and you conduct this discussion with me. But if you think he is... able to hold his own, then you be quiet, and let him discuss with me.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.19. ‘Ambattha is well-born, Reverend Gotama... We will be silent, he shall continue.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.20. Then the Lord said to Ambattha: ‘Ambattha, I have a fundamental question for you, which you will not like to answer. If you don’t answer, or evade the issue, if you keep silent or go away, your head will split into seven pieces. What do you think, Ambattha? Have you heard from old and venerable Brahmins, teachers of teachers, where the Kaṇhāyans came from, or who was their ancestor?’ At this, Ambattha remained silent. The Lord asked him a second time. [95] Again Ambattha remained silent, and the Lord said: ‘Answer me now, Ambattha, this is not a time for silence. Whoever, Ambattha, does not answer a fundamental question put to  him by a Tathāgata by the third asking has his head split into seven pieces.’<a id="calibre_link-497" href="#calibre_link-1654" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">150</sup></a></div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.21. And at that moment Vajirapāni the yakkha,<a id="calibre_link-498" href="#calibre_link-1655" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">151</sup></a> holding a huge iron club, flaming, ablaze and glowing, up in the sky just above Ambattha, was thinking: ‘If this young man Ambattha does not answer a proper question put to him by the Blessed Lord by the third time of asking, I’ll split his head into seven pieces!’ The Lord saw Vajirapāni, and so did Ambattha. And at the sight, Ambattha was terrified and unnerved, his hairs stood on end, and he sought protection, shelter and safety from the Lord. Crouching down close to the Lord, he said: ‘What did the Reverend Gotama say? May the Reverend Gotama repeat what he said!’ ‘What do you think, Ambattha? Have you heard who was the ancestor of the Kaṇhāyans?’ ‘Yes, I have heard it just as the Reverend Gotama said, that is where the Kaṇhāyans came from, he was their ancestor.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.22. Hearing this, the young men made a loud noise and clamour: ‘So Ambattha is ill-born, not of a good family, born of a slave-girl of the Sakyans, and the Sakyans are Ambattha’s masters! We disparaged the ascetic Gotama, thinking he was not speaking the truth!’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.23. Then the Lord thought: ‘It is too much, [96] the way these young men humiliate Ambattha for being the son of a slave-girl. I must get him out of this.’ So he said to the young men: ‘Don’t disparage Ambattha too much for being the son of a slave-girl! That Kanha was a mighty sage.<a id="calibre_link-499" href="#calibre_link-1656" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">152</sup></a> He went to the south country,<a id="calibre_link-500" href="#calibre_link-1657" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">153</sup></a> learnt the mantras of the Brahmins there, and then went to King Okkāka and asked for his daughter Maddarūpī. And King Okkāka, furiously angry, exclaimed: “So this fellow, the son of a slave-girl, wants my daughter!”, and put an arrow to his bow. But he was unable either to shoot the arrow or to withdraw it.<a id="calibre_link-501" href="#calibre_link-1658" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">154</sup></a> Then the ministers and counsellors came to the sage Kanha and said: “Spare the king, Reverend Sir, spare the king!”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘“The king will be safe, but if he looses the arrow downwards, the earth will quake as far as his kingdom extends.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">“‘Reverend Sir, spare the king, spare the land!”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘“The king and the land will be safe, but if he looses the  arrow upwards, as far as his realm extends the god will not let it rain for seven years.”<a id="calibre_link-502" href="#calibre_link-1659" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">155</sup></a></div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘“Reverend Sir, spare the king and the land, and may the god let it rains!”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘“The king and the land will be safe, and the god will let it rain, but if the king points the arrow at the crown prince, the prince will be completely safe.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Then the ministers exclaimed: “Let King Okkāka point the arrow at the crown prince, the prince will be perfectly safe!” The king did so, and the prince was unharmed. Then King Okkāka, terrified and fearful of divine punishment,<a id="calibre_link-503" href="#calibre_link-1660" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">156</sup></a> [97] gave away his daughter Maddarūpī. So, young men, do not disparage Ambattha too much for being the son of a slave-girl. That Kanha was a mighty sage.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.24. Then the Lord said: ‘Ambattha, what do you think? Suppose a Khattiya youth were to wed a Brahmin maiden, and there was a son of the union. Would that son of a Khattiya youth and a Brahmin maiden receive a seat and water from the Brahmins?’ ‘He would, Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Would they allow him to eat at funeral-rites, at rice-offerings, at sacrifices or as a guest?’ ‘They would, Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Would they teach him mantras or not?’ ‘They would, Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Would they keep their women covered or uncovered?’ ‘Uncovered, Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘But would the Khattiyas sprinkle him with the Khattiya consecration?’ ‘No, Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Why not?’ ‘Because, Reverend Gotama, he is not well-born on his mother’s side.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.25. ‘What do you think, Ambattha? Suppose a Brahmin youth were to wed a Khattiya maiden, and there was a son of the union.

<div class="fmtx1">‘Why not?’ ‘Because, Reverend Gotama, he is not well-born on his father’s side.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.26. ‘So, Ambattha, the Khattiyas, through a man taking a woman or a woman taking a man, are senior to the Brahmins. What do you think, Ambattha? Take the case of a Brahmin who, for some reason, has had his head shaved by the Brahmins, has been punished with a bag of ashes and banished from the country or the city. Would he receive a seat and water from the Brahmins?’ ‘No, Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Would they allow him to eat... as a guest?’ ‘No, Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Would they teach him mantras, or not?’ ‘They would not, Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Would they keep their women covered or uncovered?’ ‘Covered, Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.27. ‘What do you think, Ambattha? Take the case of a Khattiya who ... had his head shaved by the Khattiyas, ... and has been banished from the country or the city.

<div class="fmtx1">‘But that Khattiya has so far reached the extreme of humiliation [99] that he has... been banished from the country or the city. So even if a Khattiya has suffered extreme humiliation, he is superior and the Brahmins inferior.</div>

<div class="fmtx1">‘Ambattha, it is not from the standpoint of the attainment of unexcelled knowledge-and-conduct that reputation based on birth and clan is declared, nor on the conceit which says: “You are worthy of me, you are not worthy of me!” For wherever there is a giving, a taking, or a giving and taking in marriage, there is always this talk and this conceit... But those who are enslaved by such things are far from the attainment of the unexcelled knowledge-and-conduct, [100] which is attained by abandoning all such things!’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.2 ‘But, Reverend Gotama, what is this conduct, what is this knowledge?’</div>

He preaches the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its middle, lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and displays the fully-perfected and purified holy life.<a id="calibre_link-504" href="#calibre_link-1661" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">157</sup></a> <i class="calibre9">A disciple goes forth and practises the moralities</i> (<i class="calibre9">Sutta 2, verse 41 &mdash; 62</i>); <i class="calibre9">he guards the sensedoors, etc.</i> (<i class="calibre9">Sutta 2, verse 64 &mdash; 75</i>); <i class="calibre9">attains the four jhānas</i> (<i class="calibre9">Sutta 2</i>,  <i class="calibre9">verse 75 &mdash; 82</i>).

And beyond this there is no further development of knowledge and conduct that is higher or more perfect.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.3. ‘But, Ambattha, in the pursuit of this unexcelled attainment of knowledge and conduct [101] there are four paths of failure.<a id="calibre_link-505" href="#calibre_link-1662" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">158</sup></a> What are they? In the first place, an ascetic or Brahmin who has not managed to gain<a id="calibre_link-506" href="#calibre_link-1663" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">159</sup></a> this unexcelled attainment, takes his carrying-pole<a id="calibre_link-507" href="#calibre_link-1664" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">160</sup></a> and plunges into the depths of the forest thinking: “I will live on windfalls.” But in this way he only becomes an attendant on one who has attained. This is the first path of failure. Again, an ascetic or Brahmin ... , being unable to live on windfalls, takes a spade and  basket, thinking: “I will live on tubers and roots.”<a id="calibre_link-508" href="#calibre_link-1665" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">161</sup></a>... This is the second path of failure. Again, an ascetic or Brahmin, being unable to live on tubers and roots, makes a fire-hearth at the edge of a village or small town and sits tending the fame<a id="calibre_link-509" href="#calibre_link-1666" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">162</sup></a> ... This is the third path of failure. Again, an ascetic or Brahmin, being unable to tend the flame, [102] erects a house with four doors at the crossroads thinking: “Whatever ascetic or Brahmin arrives from the four quarters, I will honour to the best of my strength and ability.” But in this way he only becomes an attendant on one who has attained to unexcelled knowledge and conduct. This is the fourth path of failure.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.4. ‘What do you think, Ambattha? Do you and your teacher live in accordance with this unexcelled knowledge and conduct?’ ‘No indeed, Reverend Gotama! Who are my teacher and I in comparison? We are far from it!’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Well then, Ambattha, could you and your teacher, being unable to gain this..., go with your carrying-poles into the depths of the forest, intending to live on windfalls?’ ‘No indeed, Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Well then, Ambattha, could you and your teacher, being unable to gain this ... , live on tubers and roots,... sit tending the flame, [103]... erect a house ... ?’ ‘No indeed, Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.5. ‘And so, Ambattha, not only are you and your teacher incapable of attaining this unexcelled knowledge and conduct, but even the four paths of failure are beyond you. And yet you and your teacher the Brahmin Pokkharasāti utter these words: “These shaven little ascetics, menials, black scrapings from Brahmā’s foot, what converse can they have with Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas?” &mdash; even though you can’t even manage the duties of one who has failed. See, Ambattha, how your teacher has let you down!</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.6. ‘Ambattha, the Brahmin Pokkharasāti lives by the grace and favour of King Pasenadi of Kosala. And yet the King does not allow him to have audience face to face. When he confers with the King it is through a curtain. Why should the King not grant audience face to face to one on whom he has bestowed a proper and blameless source of revenue? See how your teacher has let you down!</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.7. ‘What do you think, Ambattha? Suppose King Pasenadi was sitting on the neck of an elephant or on horseback, or was standing on the chariot-mat, conferring with his ministers and princes about something. [104] And suppose he were to step aside and some workman or workman’s servant were to come along and stand in his place. And standing there he might say: “This is what King Pasenadi of Kosala says!” Would he be speaking the King’s words, as if he were the King’s equal?’ ‘No indeed, Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.8. ‘Well then, Ambattha, it is just the same thing. Those who were, as you say, the first sages of the Brahmins, the makers and expounders of the mantras, whose ancient verses are chanted, pronounced and collected by the Brahmins of today &mdash; Atthaka, Vamaka, Vamadeva, Vessamitta, Yamataggi, Angirasa, Bharadvaja, Vasettha, Kassapa, Bhagu<a id="calibre_link-510" href="#calibre_link-1667" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">163</sup></a> &mdash; whose mantras are said to be passed on to you and your teacher: yet you do not thereby become a sage or one practised in the way of a sage &mdash; such a thing is not possible.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.9. ‘What do you think, Ambattha? What have you heard said by Brahmins who are venerable, aged, the teachers of teachers? Those first sages..., Atthaka, ... Bhagu &mdash; did they enjoy themselves, well-bathed, perfumed, their hair and beards trimmed, adorned with garlands and wreaths, dressed in white clothes, indulging in the pleasures of the five senses and addicted to them, as you and your teacher do now?’ [105] ‘NoReverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.10. ‘Or did they eat special fine rice with the black spots removed, with various soups and curries, as you and your teacher do now?’ ‘No, Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Or did they amuse themselves with women dressed up in flounces and furbelows, as you and your teacher do now?’ ‘No, Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Or did they ride around in chariots drawn by mares with braided tails, that they urged on with long goad-sticks?’ ‘No, Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Or did they have themselves guarded in fortified towns with palisades and barricades, by men with long swords ... ?’ ‘No, Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘So, Ambattha, neither you nor your teacher are a sage or one trained in the way of a sage. And now, as for your doubts  and perplexities concerning me, we will clarify these by your asking me, and by my answering your questions.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.11 Then, descending from his lodging, the Lord started to walk up and down, and Ambattha did likewise. And as he walked along with the Lord, Ambattha looked out for the thirty-two marks of a Great Man on the Lord’s body. And he could see all of them except [106] for two. He was in doubt and perplexity about two of these marks: he could not make up his mind or be certain about the sheathed genitals or the large tongue.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.12. And the Lord, being aware of his doubts, effected by his psychic power that Ambattha could see his sheathed genitals, and then, sticking out his tongue, he reached out to lick both ears and both nostrils, and then covered the whole circle of his forehead with his tongue. Then Ambattha thought: ‘The ascetic Gotama is equipped with all the thirty-two marks of a Great Man, complete and with none missing.’ Then he said to the Lord: ‘Reverend Gotama, may I go now? I have much business, much to do.’ ‘Ambattha, do what you now think fit.’ So Ambattha got back into his chariot drawn by mares and departed.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.13. Meanwhile the Brahmin Pokkharasati had gone outside and was sitting in his park with a large number of Brahmins, just waiting for Ambattha. Then Ambattha came to the park. He rode in the chariot as far as it would go, and then continued on foot to where Pokkharasati was, saluted him, and sat down to one side. Then Pokkharasati said:</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.14. ‘Well, dear boy, did you see the Reverend Gotama?’ ‘I did, sir.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘And was the Reverend Gotama such [107] as he is reported to be, and not otherwise? And is he of such nature, and not otherwise?’ ‘Sir, he is as he is reported to be, and he is of such nature and not otherwise. He is possessed of the thirty-two marks of a Great Man, all complete, with none missing.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘But was there any conversation between you and the ascetic Gotama?’ ‘There was, sir.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘And what was this conversation about?’ So Ambattha told Pokkharasati all that had passed between the Lord and himself.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.15. At this Pokkharasāti exclaimed: ‘Well, you’re a fine little scholar, a fine wise man, a fine expert in the Three Vedas! Anyone going about his business like that ought when he dies, at the breaking-up of the body, to go to the downfall, to the evil path, to ruin, to hell! You have heaped insults on the Reverend Gotama, as a result of which he has brought up more and more things against us! You’re a fine little scholar ... !’ He was so angry and enraged that he kicked Ambattha over, and wanted to start out at once to see the Lord. [108]</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.16. But the Brahmins said: ‘It is far too late, sir, to go to see the ascetic Gotama today. The Reverend Pokkharasāti should go to see him tomorrow.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Then Pokkharasāti, having had fine hard and soft food prepared in his own home, set out by the light of torches from Ukkattha for the jungle of Icchānankala. He went by chariot as far as possible, then continued on foot to where the Lord was. Having exchanged courtesies with the Lord, he sat down to one side and said:</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.17. ‘Venerable Gotama, did not our pupil Ambattha come to see you?’ ‘He did, Brahmin.’ ‘And was there any conversation between you?’ ‘There was.’ ‘And what was this conversation about?’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Then the Lord told Pokkharasāti all that had passed between him and Ambattha. At this, Pokkharasāti said to the Lord: ‘Reverend Gotama, Ambattha is a young fool. May the Reverend Gotama pardon him.’ ‘Brahmin, may Ambattha be happy.’ [109]</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.18 &mdash; 19. Then Pokkharasāti looked out for the thirty-two marks of a Great Man on the Lord’s body and he could see all of them except for two: <i class="calibre9">the sheathed genitals and the large tongue; but the Lord set his mind at rest about these</i> (<i class="calibre9">as verse 11 &mdash; 12</i>)<i class="calibre9">.</i>  And Pokkharasāti said to the Lord: ‘May the Reverend Gotama accept a meal from me today together with his order of monks!’ And the Lord consented by silence.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.20. Seeing his acceptance, Pokkharasāti said to the Lord: ‘It is time, Reverend Gotama, the meal is ready.’ And the Lord, having dressed in the early morning and taken his robe and bowl,<a id="calibre_link-511" href="#calibre_link-1668" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">164</sup></a> went with his order of monks to Pokkharasāti’s residence, and sat down on the prepared seat. Then Pokkharasāti  personally served the Lord with choice hard and soft food, and the young men served the monks. And when the Lord had taken his hand from the bowl, Pokkharasati sat down to one side on a low stool.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.21 And as Pokkharasati sat there, [110] the Lord delivered a graduated discourse on generosity, on morality and on heaven, showing the danger, degradation and corruption of sense-desires, and the profit of renunciation. And when the Lord knew that Pokkharasāti’s mind was ready, pliable, free from the hindrances, joyful and calm, then he preached a sermon on Dhamma in brief: on suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. And just as a clean cloth from which all stains have been removed receives the dye perfectly, so in the Brahmin Pokkharasati, as he sat there, there arose the pure and spotless Dhamma-eye, and he knew: ‘Whatever things have an origin must come to cessation.’<a id="calibre_link-512" href="#calibre_link-1669" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">165</sup></a></div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.22. And Pokkharasati, having seen, attained, experienced and penetrated the Dhamma, having passed beyond doubt, transcended uncertainty, having gained perfect confidence in the Teacher’s doctrine without relying on others, said: ‘Excellent, Lord, excellent! It is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down, or to point out the way to one who had got lost, or to bring an oil-lamp into a dark place, so that those with eyes could see what was there. Just so the Blessed Lord has expounded the Dhamma in various ways ... I go with my son, my wife, my ministers and counsellors for refuge to the Reverend Gotama, to the Dhamma and to the Sangha.<a id="calibre_link-513" href="#calibre_link-1670" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">166</sup></a> May the Reverend Gotama accept me as a lay-follower who has taken refuge from this day forth as long as life shall last! And whenever the Reverend Gotama visits other families or lay-followers in Ukkattha, may he also visit the family of Pokkharasati! Whatever young men and maidens are there will revere the Reverend Gotama and rise before him, will give him a seat and water and will be glad at heart, and that will be for their welfare and happiness for a long time.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Well said, Brahmin!’</div>

<div class="fmtx">[111] 1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. Once the Lord was travelling among the Angas with a large company of some five hundred monks, and he arrived at Campa. At Campa he stayed by Gaggara’s lotus-pond. At that time the Brahmin Sonadanda was living at Campa, a populous place, full of grass, timber, water and corn, which had been given to him by King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha as a royal gift and with royal powers.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2. And the Brahmins and householders of Campa heard say: ‘The ascetic Gotama of the Sakyans, who has gone forth from the Sakya clan is travelling among the Angas...and is staying by Gaggara’s lotus-pool. And concerning that Blessed Lord Gotama a good report has been spread about: “This Blessed Lord is an Arahant, a fully-enlightened Buddha, perfected in knowledge and conduct, a Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, unequalled Trainer of men to be tamed, Teacher of gods and humans, a Buddha, a Blessed Lord.” He proclaims this world with its gods, maras, Brahmas, the world of ascetics and Brahmins with its princes and people, having come to know it by his own knowledge. He teaches a Dhamma that is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its middle and lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and he displays the fully-perfected, thoroughly purified holy life. And indeed it is good to see such Arahants.’ [112] Thereupon the Brahmins and householders of Campa, leaving Campa in great crowds, in vast numbers, went to Gaggara’s lotus-pond.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">3. Just then, the Brahmin Sonadanda had gone up to his verandah for his midday rest. Seeing all the Brahmins and householders making for Gaggarā’s lotus-pond, he asked his steward the reason.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Sir, it is the ascetic Gotama of the Sakyans ... That is why they are going to see him.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Well then, steward, go to the Brahmins and householders of Campā and say to them: “Please wait, gentlemen, the Brahmin Sonadanda will come to see the ascetic Gotama.”’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">And the steward conveyed this message to [113] the Brahmins and householders of Campā.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">4. Now at that time some five hundred Brahmins from various provinces were in Campā on some business, and they heard that Sonadanda intended to visit the ascetic Gotama. So they called upon him and asked if this were true. ‘So it is, gentlemen, I am going to visit the ascetic Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">5. ‘Sir, do not visit the ascetic Gotama, it is not fitting that you should do so! If the Reverend Sonadanda goes to visit the ascetic Gotama, his reputation will decrease, and that of the ascetic Gotama will increase. This being so, it is not right that the Reverend Sonadanda should visit the ascetic Gotama, but rather the ascetic Gotama should visit him.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘The Reverend Sonadanda is well-born on both the mother’s and the father’s side, of pure descent to the seventh generation, unbroken, of irreproachable birth, and therefore he should not call on the ascetic Gotama, but rather the ascetic Gotama should call on him. The Reverend Sonadanda is possessed of great wealth and resources... [114] The Reverend Sonadanda is a scholar, versed in the mantras, accomplished in the Three Vedas, a skilled expounder of the rules and rituals, the lore of sounds and meanings and, fifthly, oral tradition &mdash; an expounder, fully versed in natural philosophy and the marks of a Great Man. The Reverend Sonadanda is handsome, good-looking, pleasing, of the most beautiful complexion, in form and countenance like Brahmā, of no mean appearance. He is virtuous, of increasing virtue, endowed with increasing virtue. He is well-spoken, of pleasing address, polite, of pure and clear enunciation, speaking to the point. He is the teacher’s teacher of many, teaching the mantras to three hundred youths, and many young men come from different districts and regions seeking to learn the mantras in his presence, desirous to learn them from him. He is aged, grown old, venerable, advanced in years, long past his youth, whereas the ascetic Gotama is  youthful and newly gone forth as a wanderer. The Reverend Sonadanda is esteemed, made much of, honoured, revered, worshipped by King Seniya Bimbisara and by the Brahmin Pokkharasati. He lives at Campa, a populous place, full of grass, timber, water and corn, which has been given to him by King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha as a royal gift, and with royal powers. This being so, it is not proper that he should visit the ascetic Gotama, but rather the ascetic Gotama should visit him.‘<a id="calibre_link-514" href="#calibre_link-212" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">167</sup></a></div>
<div class="fmtx1">6. At this Sonadanda replied: [115] ‘Now listen, gentlemen, as to why it is fitting for us to visit the Reverend Gotama, and why it is not fitting for him to visit us. The ascetic Gotama is well-born on both sides of pure descent to the seventh generation, unbroken, of it reproachable birth...(<i class="calibre9">as verse 5</i>). Therefore it is fitting for us to visit him. He went forth, leaving a great body of kinsmen. In fact he gave up much gold and wealth to go forth, both hidden away and openly displayed. The ascetic Gotama, while youthful, a black-haired youth, in the prime of his young days, in the first stage of life went forth from the household life into homelessness. Leaving his grieving parents weeping with tear-stained faces, having cut off his hair and beard and put on yellow robes, he went forth into homelessness. He is handsome,... virtuous,... well-spoken, ... the teacher’s teacher of many. He has abandoned sensuality and dispelled vanity. He teaches action and the results of action, honouring the blameless Brahmin way of life. He is a wanderer of high birth, of a leading Khattiya family. He is a wanderer from a wealthy family, of great wealth and possessions. [116] People come to consult him from foreign kingdoms and foreign lands. Many thousands of devas have taken refuge with him.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘This good report has been spread about him: “This Blessed Lord is an Arahant, a fully-enlightened Buddha, perfected in knowledge and conduct...” (<i class="calibre9">as verse 2</i>). He bears the thirty-two marks of a Great Man. He is welcoming, kindly of speech, courteous, genial, clear and ready of speech. He is attended by four assemblies, revered, honoured, esteemed and worshipped by them. Many devas and humans are devoted to him. Whenever he stays in any town or village, that place is not troubled  by non-human beings. He has a crowd, a multitude of followers, is a teacher of many, he is consulted by the chief of the various leaders of sects. It is not the way with the ascetic Gotama’s reputation, as it is with that of some ascetics and Brahmins, about whom this or that is reported &mdash; the ascetic Gotama’s fame is based on his achievement of unsurpassed wisdom and conduct. Indeed King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha has gone for refuge to him together with his son, his wife, his followers and his ministers. So have King Pasenadi of Kosala and the Brahmin Pokkharasati. He is revered, honoured, esteemed and worshipped by them. [117]</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘The ascetic Gotama has arrived in Campa and is staying by Gaggara’s lotus-pond. And whatever ascetics and Brahmins come to our territory are our guests. And we should revere, honour, esteem and worship guests. Having come to Gaggara’s lotus-pond, the ascetic Gotama is such a guest, and should be treated as such. Therefore it is not proper that he should come to us, but rather we should go to him. However much I might praise the ascetic Gotama, that praise is insufficient, he is beyond all praise.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">7. On hearing this, the Brahmins said to Sonadanda: ‘Sir, since you praise the ascetic Gotama so much, then even if he were to live a hundred yojanas from here, it would be fitting for a believing clansman to go with a shoulder-bag to visit him. And so, sir, we shall all go to visit the ascetic Gotama.’ And so Sonadanda went with a large company of Brahmins to Gaggarā’s lotus-pond.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">8. But when Sonadanda had traversed the jungle-thickets, he thought: ‘If I ask the ascetic Gotama a question, he might say to me: “That, Brahmin, is not a fitting question, it is not at all a fitting question”, and then the company might despise me, saying: “Sonadanda is a fool, he has no sense, [118] he can’t put a proper question to the ascetic Gotama.” And if anyone were despised by this company, his reputation would suffer, and then his income would suffer, for our income depends on the gaining of a reputation. Or if the ascetic Gotama were to ask me a question, my answer might not satisfy him, and he might say: “That is not the right way to answer this question.” And then the company might despise me ... And if,  having come into the presence of the ascetic Gotama, I were to turn away without showing myself, this company might despise me...’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">9. Then Sonadanda approached the Lord, exchanged courtesies with him, and sat down to one side. Some of the Brahmins and householders made obeisance to the Lord, some exchanged courtesies with him, some saluted him with joined palms, some announced their name and clan, and some sat down to one side in silence. [119]</div>
<div class="fmtx1">10. So Sonadanda took his seat with many thoughts going through his mind: ‘If I ask the ascetic Gotama a question, he might say to me: “That, Brahmin, is not a fitting question...” If only the ascetic Gotama would ask me a question from my own field of the Three Vedas! Then I could give him an answer that would satisfy him!’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">11. And the Lord, reading his mind, thought: ‘This Sonadanda is worried. Suppose I were to ask him a question from his own field as a teacher of the Three Vedas!’ So he said to Sonadanda: ‘By how many qualities do Brahmins recognise a Brahmin? How would one declare truthfully and without falling into falsehood: “I am a Brahmin”?’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">12. Then Sonadanda thought: [120] ‘Now what I wanted, hoped for, desired and longed for has happened... Now I can give him an answer that will satisfy him.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">13. Straightening up, and looking round the assembly, he said: ‘Reverend Gotama, there are five such qualities... What are they? A Brahmin is well-born on both the mother’s and the father’s side, of pure descent to the seventh generation,... he is a scholar versed in the mantras, ... he is handsome, pleasing,... he is virtuous,... he is learned and wise, and is the first or second to hold the sacrificial ladle. These are the five qualities of a true Brahmin.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">14. ‘But if one of these five qualities were omitted, could not one be recognised as a true Brahmin, being possessed of four of these qualities?’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘It is possible, Gotama. We could leave out appearance, for what does that matter? If a Brahmin had the other four qualities [121] he could be recognised as a true Brahmin.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">15. ‘But could not one of these four qualities be omitted,  leaving three whereby one could be recognised as a true Brahmin?’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘It is possible, Gotama. We could leave out the mantras, for what do they matter? If he had the other three qualities he could be recognised as a true Brahmin.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">16. ‘But could not one of these three qualities be omitted ... ?’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘It is possible, Gotama. We could leave out birth, for what does that matter? If a Brahmin is virtuous, of increasing virtue, ... and if he is learned and wise, and is the first or second to hold the sacrificial ladle &mdash; then he can be recognised as a true Brahmin and truthfully claim to be so.’ [122]</div>
<div class="fmtx1">17. At this the Brahmins said to Sonadanda: ‘Don’t say that, Sonadanda don’t say it! The Reverend Sonadanda is decrying appearance, the mantras and birth, he is actually adopting the ascetic Gotama’s own words!’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">18. Then the Lord said to the Brahmins: ‘If you think the Brahmin Sonadanda is not concentrating on his task, is using wrong words, is lacking in wisdom, and is not fit to converse with the ascetic Gotama, then let him cease, and you talk to me. But if you think he is learned, speaks properly, is wise and fit to converse with the ascetic Gotama, then you cease and let him speak.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">19. Then Sonadanda said to the Lord: ‘Let that be, Reverend Gotama, and be silent. I will answer in this matter.’ To the Brahmins he said: ‘Do not say the Reverend Sonadanda is decrying appearance... and adopting the ascetic Gotama’s own words! [123] I do not decry appearance, mantras, or birth.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">20. Now at that time Sonadanda’s nephew, a young man called Angaka, was sitting in the assembly, and Sonadanda said: ‘Gentlemen, do you see my nephew Angaka?’ ‘Yes, sir.’ ‘Angaka is handsome, good-looking, pleasing, of supremely fair complexion, in form and countenance like Brahmā, of no mean appearance, and there is none in this assembly his equal except the ascetic Gotama. He is a scholar...I was his mantra-teacher. He is well-born on both sides... I know his parents. But if Angaka were to take life, take what is not given, commit adultery, tell lies and drink strong drink &mdash; what would good looks, or mantras, or birth profit him? But it  is because a Brahmin is virtuous,... because he is wise ... : on account of these two points that he can truthfully declare: “I am a Brahmin.”’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">21. ‘But, Brahmin, if one were to omit one of these two points, could one truthfully declare: “I am a Brahmin”?’ [124] ‘No, Gotama. For wisdom is purified by morality, and morality is purified by wisdom: where one is, the other is, the moral man has wisdom and the wise man has morality, and the combination of morality and wisdom is called the highest thing in the world. Just as one hand washes the other, or one foot the other, so wisdom is purified by morality and this combination is called the highest thing in the world.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">22. ‘So it is, Brahmin. Wisdom is purified by morality, and morality is purified by wisdom: where one is, the other is, the moral man has wisdom and the wise man has morality, and the combination of morality and wisdom is called the highest thing in the world. But, Brahmin, what is this morality and what is this wisdom?’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘We only know this much, Gotama. It would be well if the Reverend Gotama were to explain the meaning of this.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">23. ‘Then listen, Brahmin, pay proper attention, and I will tell you.’ ‘Yes, sir’, said Sonadanda in reply, and the Lord said:</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Brahmin, a Tathagata arises in this world, an Arahant, fully-enlightened Buddha, endowed with wisdom and conduct, Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed, Teacher of gods and humans, enlightened and blessed. He, having realised it by his own super-knowledge, proclaims this world with its devas, maras and Brahmas, its princes and people. He preaches the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its middle, lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and displays the fully-perfected and purified holy life. <i class="calibre9">A disciple goes forth and practises the moralities</i> (<i class="calibre9">Sutta</i> <i class="calibre9">2</i><i class="calibre9">, verses 41 &mdash; 63); he guards the sensedoors, etc.</i> (<i class="calibre9">Sutta 2</i>, <i class="calibre9">verses 64 &mdash; 74</i>). That, Brahmin, is morality.<a id="calibre_link-515" href="#calibre_link-213" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">168</sup></a>  <i class="calibre9">He attains the four jhānas</i> (<i class="calibre9">Sutta 2</i>, <i class="calibre9">verses</i> <b class="calibre5">75 &mdash; 82</b>); <i class="calibre9">he attains various insights</i> (<i class="calibre9">Sutta 2</i>, <i class="calibre9">verses 83 &mdash; 95), and the cessation of the</i>  <i class="calibre9">corruptions</i> (<i class="calibre9">Sutta 2</i>, <i class="calibre9">verse 97</i>). Thus he develops wisdom. That, Brahmin, is wisdom.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">24. At these words Sonadanda said: ‘Excellent, Lord, excellent! It is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down, or to point out the way to one who had got lost, or to bring an oil-lamp into a dark place, so that those with eyes could see what was there. Just so the Blessed Lord has expounded the Dhamma in various ways. And I go for refuge to the Blessed Lord Gotama, to the Dhamma and to the Sangha. May the Reverend Gotama accept me from this day forth as a lay-follower as long as life shall last! And may the Reverend Gotama and his order of monks accept a meal from me tomorrow! ’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">The Lord assented by silence. Then Sonadanda, seeing his assent, rose, saluted the Lord, passed by to his right and departed. As day was breaking, he caused hard and soft food to be prepared in his own home, and when it was ready he announced: ‘Reverend Gotama, it is time; the meal is ready.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">25. And the Lord, having risen early, went with robe and bowl and attended by his monks to Sonadanda’s residence and sat down on the prepared seat. And Sonadanda served the Buddha and his monks with the finest foods with his own hands until they were satisfied. And when the Lord had eaten and taken his hand away from the bowl, Sonadanda took a low stool and sat down to one side. Then he said to the Lord:</div>
<div class="fmtx1">26. ‘Reverend Gotama, if when I have gone into the assembly I were to rise and salute the Lord, the company would despise me. In that case my reputation would suffer, and if a man’s reputation suffers, his income suffers ... So if, on entering the assembly, I should join my palms in greeting, may the Reverend Gotama take it as if I had risen from my seat. And if [126] on entering the assembly I should take off my turban, may you take it as if I had bowed at your feet. Or if, when riding in my carriage, I were to alight to salute the Lord, the company would despise me ... So if, when I am riding in my carriage, I raise my goad, may you take it as if I had alighted from my carriage, and if I lower my hand, may you take it as if I had bowed my head at your feet.’<a id="calibre_link-516" href="#calibre_link-214" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">169</sup></a></div>
<div class="fmtx1">27. Then the Lord, having instructed Sonadanda with a talk on Dhamma, inspired him, fired him with enthusiasm and delighted him, rose from his seat and departed.</div>

<div class="cst"><b class="calibre5">A Bloodless Sacrifice</b></div>
<div class="fmtx">[127] 1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. Once the Lord was travelling through Magadha with a large company of some five hundred monks, and he arrived at a Brahmin village called Khānumata. And there he stayed at the Ambalatthika park.<a id="calibre_link-517" href="#calibre_link-1954" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">170</sup></a> Now at that time the Brahmin Kutadanta was living at Khanumata, a populous place, full of grass, timber, water and corn, which had been given to him by King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha as a royal gift and with royal powers.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">And Kutadanta planned a great sacrifice: seven hundred bulls, seven hundred bullocks, seven hundred heifers, seven hundred he-goats and seven hundred rams were all tied up to the sacrificial posts.<a id="calibre_link-518" href="#calibre_link-1955" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">171</sup></a></div>
<div class="fmtx1">2. And the Brahmins and householders of Khānumata heard say: ‘The ascetic Gotama...is staying at Ambalatthika. And concerning that Blessed Lord Gotama a good report has been spread about: “This Blessed Lord is an Arahant, a fully-enlightened Buddha, perfected in knowledge and conduct, a Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, unequalled Trainer of men to be tamed, Teacher of gods and humans, a Buddha, a Blessed Lord.” [128] He proclaims this world with its gods, maras and Brahmas, the world of ascetics and Brahmins with its princes and people, having come to know it by his own knowledge. He teaches a Dhamma that is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its middle and lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and he displays the fully-perfected, thoroughly purified holy life. And indeed it is good to see such Arahants.’ And at that the Brahmins and householders, leaving Khānumata in great numbers, went to Ambalatthika.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">3. Just then, Kutadanta had gone up to his verandah for his  midday rest. Seeing all the Brahmins and householders making for Ambalaṭṭhikā, he asked his steward the reason. The steward replied: ‘Sir, it is the ascetic Gotama, concerning whom a good report has been spread about: “This Blessed Lord is an Arahant, ... a Buddha, a Blessed Lord”. That is why they are going to see him.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">4. Then Kūṭadanta thought: ‘I have heard that the ascetic Gotama understands how to conduct successfully the triple sacrifice with its sixteen requisites. Now I do not understand all this, but I want to make a big sacrifice. Suppose [129] I were to go to the ascetic Gotama and ask him about the matter.’ So he sent his steward to the Brahmins and householders of Khānumata to ask them to wait for him.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">5. And at that time several hundred Brahmins were staying at Khānumata intending to take part in Kūṭadanta’s sacrifice. Hearing of his intention to visit the ascetic Gotama, they went and asked him if this were true. ‘So it is, gentlemen, I am going to visit the ascetic Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">6. ‘Sir, do not visit the ascetic Gotama...(<i class="calibre9">exactly the same arguments as at Sutta</i> <i class="calibre9">4</i><i class="calibre9">, verse</i> <i class="calibre9">5</i>). [130 &mdash; 131] This being so, it is not proper that the Reverend Kūṭadanta should visit the ascetic Gotama, but rather the ascetic Gotama should visit him.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">7. Then Kūṭadanta said to the Brahmins: ‘Now listen, gentlemen, as to why it is fitting for us to visit the Reverend Gotama, and why it is not fitting for him to visit us... (<i class="calibre9">exactly the same as Sutta</i> <i class="calibre9">4</i><i class="calibre9">, verse 6</i>). [132 &mdash; 133] The ascetic Gotama has arrived in Khānumata and is staying at Ambalaṭṭhikā. And whatever ascetics or Brahmins come to our territory are our guests ... He is beyond all praise.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">8. On hearing this, the Brahmins said: ‘Sir, since you praise the ascetic Gotama so much, then even if he were to live a hundred yojanas from here, it would be fitting for a believing clansman to go with a shoulder-bag to visit him. And, sir, we shall all go to visit the ascetic Gotama.’ And so Kūṭadanta went with a large company of Brahmins to Ambalaṭṭhikā. He approached the Lord, [134] exchanged courtesies with him, and sat down to one side. Some of the Brahmins and householders of Khānumata made obeisance to the Lord, some exchanged courtesies with him, some saluted him with joined  palms, some announced their name and clan, and some sat down to one side in silence.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">9. Sitting to one side, Kūtadanta addressed the Lord: ‘Reverend Gotama, I have heard that you understand how to conduct successfully the triple sacrifice with its sixteen requisites. Now I do not understand all this, but I want to make a big sacrifice. It would be well if the ascetic Gotama were to explain this to me.’ ‘Then listen, Brahmin, pay proper attention, and I will explain.’ ‘Yes, sir’, said Kūṭadanta, and the Lord said:</div>
<div class="fmtx1">10. ‘Brahmin, once upon a time there was a king called Mahāvijita.<a id="calibre_link-519" href="#calibre_link-1956" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">172</sup></a> He was rich, of great wealth and resources, with an abundance of gold and silver, of possessions and requisites, of money and money’s worth, with a full treasury and granary. And when King Mahāvijita was musing in private, the thought came to him: “I have acquired extensive wealth in human terms, I occupy a wide extent of land which I have conquered. Suppose now I were to make a great sacrifice which would be to my benefit and happiness for a long time?” And calling his minister-chaplain,<a id="calibre_link-520" href="#calibre_link-1957" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">173</sup></a> he told him his thought. [135] “1 want to make a big sacrifice. Instruct me, Reverend Sir, how this may be to my lasting benefit and happiness.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">11. ‘The chaplain replied: “Your Majesty’s country is beset by thieves, it is ravaged, villages and towns are being destroyed, the countryside is infested with brigands. If Your Majesty were to tax this region, that would be the wrong thing to do. Suppose Your Majesty were to think: ‘I will get rid of this plague of robbers by executions and imprisonment, or by confiscation, threats and banishment’, the plague would not be properly ended. Those who survived would later harm Your Majesty’s realm. However, with this plan you can completely eliminate the plague. To those in the kingdom who are engaged in cultivating crops and raising cattle, let Your Majesty distribute grain and fodder; to those in trade, give capital; to those in government service assign proper living wages. Then those people, being intent on their own occupations, will not harm the kingdom. Your Majesty’s revenues will be great, the land will be tranquil and not beset by thieves, and the people,  with joy in their hearts, will play with their children, and will dwell in open houses.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘And saying: “So be it!”, the king accepted the chaplain’s advice: he gave grain and fodder, capital to those in trade,... proper living wages... and the people with joy in their hearts ... dwelt in open houses.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">12. ‘Then King Mahāvijita sent for the chaplain and said: “I have got rid of the plague of robbers; following your plan my revenue has grown, the land is tranquil and not beset by thieves, and the people with joy in their hearts play with their children and dwell in open houses. Now I wish to make a great sacrifice. Instruct me as to how this may be done to my lasting benefit and happiness.” “For this, Sire, you should send for your Khattiyas from town and country, your advisers and counsellors, the most influential Brahmins and the wealthy householders of your realm, and say to them: ‘I wish to make a great sacrifice. Assist me in this, gentlemen, that it may be to my lasting benefit and happiness.’”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘The King agreed, and [137] did so. “Sire, let the sacrifice begin, now is the time, Your Majesty. These four assenting groups<a id="calibre_link-521" href="#calibre_link-1958" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">174</sup></a> will be the accessories for the sacrifice.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">13. “‘King Mahāvijita is endowed with eight things. He is well-born on both sides,... (<i class="calibre9">as Sutta 4</i>, <i class="calibre9">verse 5</i>) of irreproachable birth. He is handsome, ... of no mean appearance. He is rich ... with a full treasury and granary. He is powerful, having a four-branched army<a id="calibre_link-522" href="#calibre_link-1959" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">175</sup></a> that is loyal, dependable, making bright his reputation among his enemies. He is a faithful giver and host, not shutting his door against ascetics, Brahmins and wayfarers, beggars and the needy &mdash; a fountain of goodness. He is very learned in what should be learnt. He knows the meaning of whatever is said, saying: ‘This is what that means.’ He is a scholar, accomplished, wise, competent to perceive advantage in the past, the future or the present. <a id="calibre_link-523" href="#calibre_link-1960" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">176</sup></a>  King Mahāvijita is endowed with these eight things. These constitute the accessories for the sacrifice.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">[138] 14. “‘The Brahmin chaplain is endowed with four things. He is well-born...He is a scholar, versed in the mantras ... He is virtuous, of increasing virtue, endowed with increasing virtue. He is learned, accomplished and wise, and is the  first or second to hold the sacrificial ladle. He has these four qualities. These constitute the accessories to the sacrifice.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">15. ‘Then, prior to the sacrifice, the Brahmin chaplain taught the King the three modes. “It might be that Your Majesty might have some regrets about the intended sacrifice: ‘I am going to lose a lot of wealth’, or during the sacrifice: ‘I am losing a lot of wealth’, or after the sacrifice: ‘I have lost a lot of wealth.’ In such cases, Your Majesty should not entertain such regrets.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">16. ‘Then, prior to the sacrifice, the chaplain dispelled the King’s qualms with ten conditions for the recipient: “Sire, there will come to the sacrifice those who take life and those who abstain from taking life. To those who take life, so will it be to them; but those who abstain from taking life will have a successful sacrifice and will rejoice in it, and their hearts may be calmed within. There will come those who take what is not given and those who refrain..., those who indulge in sexual misconduct and those who refrain..., those who tell lies..., indulge in calumny, harsh and frivolous speech..., [139] those who are covetous and those who are not, those who harbour ill-will and those who do not, those who have wrong views and those who have right views. To those who have wrong views it will turn out accordingly, but those who have right views will have a successful sacrifice and will rejoice in it, and their hearts may be calmed within.” So the chaplain dispelled the King’s doubts with ten conditions.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">17. ‘So the chaplain instructed the King who was making the great sacrifice with sixteen reasons, urged him, inspired him and gladdened his heart. “Someone might say: ‘King Mahāvijita is making a great sacrifice, but he has not invited his Khattiyas..., his advisers and counsellors, the most influential Brahmins and wealthy householders...’ But such words would not be in accordance with the truth, since the King has invited them. Thus the King may know that he will have a successful sacrifice and rejoice in it, and his heart will be calmed within. Or someone might say: ‘King Mahāvijita is making a great sacrifice, but he is not well-born on both sides...’[140] But such words would not be in accordance with the truth... Or someone might say: ‘His chaplain is not  well-born...’ [141] But such words would not be in accordance with the truth.” Thus the chaplain instructed the King with sixteen reasons...</div>
<div class="fmtx1">18. ‘In this sacrifice, Brahmin, no bulls were slain, no goats or sheep, no cocks and pigs, nor were various living beings subjected to slaughter, nor were trees cut down for sacrificial posts, nor were grasses mown for the sacrificial grass, and those who are called slaves or servants or workmen did not perform their tasks for fear of blows or threats, weeping and in tears. But those who wanted to do something did it, those who did not wish to did not: they did what they wanted to do, and not what they did not want to do. The sacrifice was carried out with ghee, oil, butter, curds, honey and molasses. [142]</div>
<div class="fmtx1">19. ‘Then, Brahmin, the Khattiyas ... , the ministers and counsellors, the influential Brahmins, the wealthy householders of town and country, having received a sufficient income, came to King Mahāvijita and said: “We have brought sufficient wealth, Your Majesty, please accept it.” “But, gentlemen, I have collected together sufficient wealth. Whatever is left over, you take away.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘At the King’s refusal, they went away to one side and consulted together: “It is not right for us to take this wealth back to our own homes. The King is making a great sacrifice. Let us follow his example.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">20. ‘Then the Khattiyas put their gifts to the east of the sacrificial pit, the advisers and counsellors set out theirs to the south, the Brahmins to the west and the wealthy householders to the north. And in this sacrifice no bulls were slain,... nor were living beings subjected to slaughter...Those who wanted to do something did it, those who did not wish to did not... The sacrifice was carried out with ghee, oil, butter, curds, honey and molasses. [143] Thus there were the four assenting groups, and King Mahāvijita was endowed with eight things, and the chaplain with four things in three modes. This, Brahmin, is called the sixteenfold successful sacrifice in three modes.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">21. At this the Brahmins shouted loudly and noisily: ‘What a splendid sacrifice! What a splendid way to perform a sacrifice! ’ But Kutadanta sat in silence. And the Brahmins asked  him why he did not applaud the ascetic Gotama’s fine words. He replied: ‘It is not that I do not applaud them. My head would split open if I did not.<a id="calibre_link-524" href="#calibre_link-1961" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">177</sup></a> But it strikes me that the ascetic Gotama does not say: “I have heard this”, or “It must have been like this”, but he says: “It was like this or like that at the time.” And so, gentlemen, it seems to me that the ascetic Gotama must have been at that time either King Mahavijita, the lord of the sacrifice, or else the Brahmin chaplain who conducted the sacrifice for him. Does the Reverend Gotama acknowledge that he performed, or caused to be performed, such a sacrifice, and that in consequence at death, after the breaking-up of the body, he was reborn in a good sphere, a heavenly state?’ ‘I do, Brahmin. I was the Brahmin chaplain who conducted that sacrifice.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">22. ‘And, Reverend Gotama, is there any other sacrifice that is simpler, less difficult, more fruitful and profitable than this threefold sacrifice with its sixteen attributes?’ [144] ‘There is, Brahmin.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘What is it, Reverend Gotama?’ ‘Wherever regular family gifts are given to virtuous ascetics, these constitute a sacrifice more fruitful and profitable than that.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">23. ‘Why, Reverend Gotama, and for what reason is this better?’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Brahmin, no Arahants or those who have attained the Arahant path will attend such a sacrifice. Why? Because there they see beatings and throttlings, so they do not attend. But they will attend the sacrifice at which regular family gifts are given to virtuous ascetics, because there there are no beatings or throttlings. That is why this kind of sacrifice is more fruitful and profitable.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">24. ‘But, Reverend Gotama, is there any other sacrifice that is more profitable than [145] either of these?’ ‘There is, Brahmin.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘What is it, Reverend Gotama?’ ‘Brahmin, if anyone provides shelter for the Sangha coming from the four quarters, that constitutes a more profitable sacrifice.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">25. ‘But, Reverend Gotama, is there any sacrifice that is more profitable than these three?’ ‘There is, Brahmin.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘What is it, Reverend Gotama?’ ‘Brahmin, if anyone with a pure heart goes for refuge to the Buddha, the Dhamma and  the Sangha, that constitutes a sacrifice more profitable than [146] any of these three.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">26. ‘But, Reverend Gotama, is there any sacrifice that is more profitable than these four?’ ‘There is, Brahmin.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘What is it, Reverend Gotama?’ ‘Brahmin, if anyone with a pure heart undertakes the precepts &mdash; to refrain from taking life, from taking what is not given, from sexual immorality, from lying speech and from taking strong drink and sloth-producing drugs &mdash; that constitutes a sacrifice more profitable than any of these four.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">27. ‘But, Reverend Gotama, is there any sacrifice that is more profitable than these five?’ ‘There is, Brahmin.’ [147]</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘What is it, Reverend Gotama?’ ‘Brahmin, a Tathagata arises in this world, an Arahant, fully-enlightened Buddha, endowed with wisdom and conduct, Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed, Teacher of gods and humans, enlightened and blessed. He, having realised it by his own super-knowledge, proclaims this world with its devas, maras and Brahmas, its princes and people. He preaches the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its middle, lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and displays the fully-perfected and purified holy life. A  <i class="calibre9">disciple goes forth and practises the moralities, etc.</i> (<i class="calibre9">Sutta 2, verses 41 &mdash; 74</i>). Thus a monk is perfected in morality. <i class="calibre9">He attains the four jhānas</i> (<i class="calibre9">Sutta</i> <i class="calibre9">2</i><i class="calibre9">, verses 75 &mdash; 82</i>). That, Brahmin, is a sacrifice ... more profitable. <i class="calibre9">He attains various insights</i> (<i class="calibre9">Sutta</i> <i class="calibre9">2</i><i class="calibre9">, verse 83 &mdash; 95</i>)<i class="calibre9">, and the cessation of the corruptions</i> (<i class="calibre9">Sutta</i> <i class="calibre9">2</i><i class="calibre9">, verse 97)</i>. He knows: “There is nothing further in this world.” That, Brahmin, is a sacrifice that is simpler, less difficult, more fruitful and more profitable than all the others. And beyond this there is no sacrifice that is greater and more perfect.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">28. ‘Excellent, Reverend Gotama, excellent! It is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down, or to point out the way to one who had got lost, or to bring an oil-lamp into a dark place, so that those with eyes could see what was there. Just so the Reverend Gotama has expounded the Dhamma in various ways, May the Reverend Gotama accept me as a lay-follower from this day forth as long as life shall last! And, [148] Reverend Gotama, I set free the seven hundred bulls,  seven hundred bullocks, seven hundred heifers, seven hundred he-goats and seven hundred rams. I grant them life, let them be fed with green grass and given cool water to drink, and let cool breezes play upon them.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">29. Then the Lord delivered a graduated discourse to Kūṭadanta, on generosity, on morality and on heaven, showing the danger, degradation and corruption of sense-desires, and the profit of renunciation. And when the Lord knew that Kūṭadanta’s mind was ready, pliable, free from the hindrances, joyful and calm, then he preached a sermon on Dhamma in brief: on suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. And just as a clean cloth from which all stains have been removed receives the dye perfectly, so in the Brahmin Kūṭadanta, as he sat there, there arose the pure and spotless Dhamma-eye, and he knew: ‘Whatever things have an origin must come to cessation.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">30. Then Kūṭadanta, having seen, attained, experienced and penetrated the Dhamma, having passed beyond doubt, transcended uncertainty, having gained perfect confidence in the Teacher’s doctrine without relying on others, said: ‘May the Reverend Gotama and his order of monks accept a meal from me tomorrow!’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">The Lord assented by silence. Then Kūṭadanta, seeing his consent, rose, saluted the Lord, passed by to his right and departed. As day was breaking, he caused hard and soft food to be prepared at his place of sacrifice, and when it was ready he announced: ‘Reverend Gotama, it is time; the meal is ready.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">And the Lord, having risen early, went with robe and bowl and attended by his monks to Kūṭadanta’s place of sacrifice and sat down on the prepared seat. And Kūṭadanta [149] served the Buddha and his monks with the finest foods with his own hands until they were satisfied. And when the Lord had eaten and taken his hand away from the bowl, Kūṭadanta took a low stool and sat down to one side.</div>
<div class="calibre3">&nbsp;<br class="calibre3" /></div><div class="fmtx">Then the Lord, having instructed Kūṭadanta with a talk on Dhamma, inspired him, fired him with enthusiasm and delighted him, rose from his seat and departed.<a id="calibre_link-525" href="#calibre_link-1962" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">178</sup></a></div>

<div class="fmtx">[150] 1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. Once the Lord was staying at Vesālī, at the Gabled Hall in the Great Forest. And at that time a large number of Brahmin emissaries from Kosala and Magadha were staying at Vesālī on some business. And they heard say: ‘The ascetic Gotama, son of the Sakyans, who has gone forth from the Sakya clan, is staying at Vesālī, at the Gabled Hall in the Great Forest. And concerning that Blessed Lord a good report has been spread about: “This Blessed Lord is an Arahant, a fully-enlightened Buddha, perfected in knowledge and conduct, a Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, unequalled Trainer of men to be tamed, Teacher of gods and humans, a Buddha, a Blessed Lord.” He proclaims this world with its gods, māras and Brahmas, the world of ascetics and Brahmins with its princes and peoples, having come to know it by his own knowledge. He teaches a Dhamma that is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its middle and lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and he displays the fully-perfected, thoroughly purified holy life. And indeed it is good to see such Arahants.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2. And so these Brahmin emissaries from Kosala and Magadha went to the Great Forest, to the Gabled Hall. At that time the Venerable Nāgita was the Lord’s personal attendant. So they approached the Venerable Nāgita and said: ‘Reverend Nāgita, where is the Reverend Gotama now staying? We would like to see him.’ [151]</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Friends, it is not the right time to see the Lord. He is in solitary meditation.’ But the Brahmins just sat down to one side and said: ‘When we have seen the Lord Gotama, we will go.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">3. Just then Otthaddha the Licchavi came to the Gabled Hall  with a large company, saluted the Venerable Nāgita and stood aside, saying: ‘Where is the Blessed Lord staying, the Arahant, the fully-enlightened Buddha? We would like to see him.’ ‘Mahāli,<a id="calibre_link-526" href="#calibre_link-114" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">179</sup></a> it is not the right time to see the Lord, He is in solitary meditation.’ But Otthaddha just sat down to one side, and said: ‘When I have seen the Blessed Lord, the Arahant, the fully-enlightened Buddha, I will go.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">4. Then the novice Sīha<a id="calibre_link-527" href="#calibre_link-115" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">180</sup></a> came to the Venerable Nāgita, stood aside and said: ‘Venerable Kassapa,<a id="calibre_link-528" href="#calibre_link-116" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">181</sup></a> these many Brahmin emissaries from Kosala and Magadha have come here to see the Lord, and Otthaddha the Licchavi, too, has come with a large company to see the Lord. It would be well, Venerable Kassapa, to allow these people to see him.’ ‘Well then, Siha, you announce them to the Lord.’ ‘Yes, Venerable Sir’, said Siha. Then he went to the Lord, saluted him, stood aside and said: ‘Lord, these Brahmin emissaries from Kosala and Magadha have come here to see the Lord, and Otthaddha the Licchavi likewise with a large [152] company. It would be well if the Lord were to let these people see him.’ ‘Then, Siha, prepare a seat in the shade of this dwelling.’ ‘Yes, Lord’, said Siha, and did so. Then the Lord came out of his dwelling-place and sat down on the prepared seat.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">5. The Brahmins approached the Lord. Having exchanged courtesies with him, they sat down to one side. But Otthaddha did obeisance to the Lord, and then sat down to one side, saying: ‘Lord, not long ago Sunakkhatta the Licchavi<a id="calibre_link-529" href="#calibre_link-117" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">182</sup></a> came to me and said: “Soon I shall have been a follower of the Lord for three years. I have seen heavenly sights, pleasant, delightful, enticing, but I have not heard any heavenly sounds that were pleasant, delightful, enticing.” Lord, are there any such heavenly sounds, which Sunakkhatta cannot hear, or are there not?’ ‘There are such sounds, Mahāli.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">6. ‘Then, Lord, what is the reason, what is the cause why Sunakkahtta cannot hear them?’ [153] ‘Mahāli, in one case a monk, facing east, goes into one-sided samādhi<a id="calibre_link-530" href="#calibre_link-118" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">183</sup></a> and sees heavenly sights, pleasant, delightful, enticing... but does not hear heavenly sounds. By means of this one-sided samadhi he sees heavenly sights but does not hear heavenly sounds. Why  is this? Because this samādhi only leads to the seeing of heavenly sights, but not to the hearing of heavenly sounds.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">7. ‘Again, a monk facing south, west, north goes into a one-sided samādhi and facing upwards, downwards or across sees heavenly sights [in that direction], but does not hear heavenly sounds. Why is this? Because this samādhi only leads to the seeing of heavenly sights, but not to the hearing of heavenly sounds. [154]</div>
<div class="fmtx1">8. ‘In another case, Mahāli, a monk facing east...hears heavenly sounds but does not see heavenly sights...</div>
<div class="fmtx1">9. ‘Again, a monk facing south, west, north, facing upwards, downwards or across hears heavenly sounds, but does not see heavenly sights...</div>
<div class="fmtx1">10. ‘In another case, Mahāli, a monk facing east goes into two-sided samādhi and both sees heavenly sights, pleasant, delightful, enticing [155] and hears heavenly sounds. Why is this? Because this two-sided samadhi leads to both the seeing of heavenly sights and the hearing of heavenly sounds.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">11. ‘Again, a monk facing south, west, north, facing upwards, downwards or across sees heavenly sights and hears heavenly sounds ... And that is the reason why Sunakkhatta comes to see heavenly sights but not to hear heavenly sounds.’<a id="calibre_link-531" href="#calibre_link-119" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">184</sup></a></div>
<div class="fmtx1">12. ‘Well, Lord, is it for the realisation of such samādhistates that monks lead the holy life under the Blessed Lord?’ ‘No, Mahāli, there are other things, higher and more perfect than these, for the sake of which monks lead the holy life under me.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">[156] 13. ‘What are they, Lord?’ ‘Mahāli, in one case a monk, having abandoned three fetters, becomes a Stream-Winner, not liable to states of woe, firmly set on the path to enlightenment. Again, a monk who has abandoned the three fetters, and has reduced his greed, hatred and delusion, becomes a Once-Returner who, having returned to this world once more, will make an end of suffering. Again, a monk who has abandoned the five lower fetters takes a spontaneous rebirth <a id="calibre_link-532" href="#calibre_link-120" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">185</sup></a> [in a higher sphere] and, without returning from that world, gains enlightenment. Again, a monk through the extinction of  the corruptions reaches in this very life the uncorrupted deliverance of mind, the deliverance through wisdom, which he has realised by his own insight. That is another thing higher and more perfect than these, for the sake of which monks lead the holy life under me.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">14. ‘Lord, is there a path, is there a method for the realisation of these things?’ ‘There is a path, Mahāli, there is a method.’ [157] ‘And, Lord, what is this path, what is this method?’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘It is the Noble Eightfold Path, namely Right View, Right Thought; Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood; Right Effort, Right Mindfulness and Right Concentration. This is the path, this is the way to the realisation of these things.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">15. ‘Once, Mahāli, I was staying at Kosambi, in the Ghosita Park. And two wanderers, Mandissa and Jāliya, the pupil of the wooden-bowl ascetic, came to me, exchanged courtesies with me, and sat down to one side. Then they said: “How is it, friend Gotama, is the soul<a id="calibre_link-533" href="#calibre_link-121" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">186</sup></a> the same as the body, or is the soul one thing and the body another?” “Well now, friends, you listen, pay proper attention, and I will explain.” “Yes, friend”, they said, and I went on:</div>
<div class="fmtx1">16. ‘“Friends, a Tathagata arises in the world, an Arahant, fully-enlightened Buddha, endowed with wisdom and conduct, Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed, Teacher of gods and humans, enlightened and blessed.

Being thus detached from sense-desires, detached from unwholesome states, he enters and  remains in the first jhāna ... and so suffuses, drenches, fills and irradiates his body, that there is no spot in his entire body that is untouched by this delight and joy born of detachment. Now of one who thus knows and thus sees, is it proper to say: ‘The soul is the same as the body’, or ‘The soul is different from the body’?” “It is not, friend.”<a id="calibre_link-534" href="#calibre_link-122" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">187</sup></a> “But I thus know and see, and I do not say that the soul is either the same as, or different from the body.”</div>

<div class="fmtx1">4. ‘Kassapa, there are some ascetics and Brahmins who are wise, skilled, practised in disputation, splitters of hairs, acute,  who walk cleverly along the paths of views.

But, Kassapa, because there is a very different kind of asceticism beside this, therefore it is right to say: “It is hard to be an ascetic, it is hard to be a Brahmin.” [169] But, Kassapa, when a monk develops non-enmity, non-ill-will and a heart full of loving kindness ...

<div class="fmtx1">18 &mdash; 20. Then Kassapa said to the Lord: ‘Reverend Gotama, what then is the development of morality, of the heart, and of wisdom?’</div>

<div class="fmtx1">21. ‘Kassapa, there are some ascetics and Brahmins who preach morality. They praise morality in various ways. But as regards the highest Ariyan morality, Kassapa, I do not see any who have surpassed me in this. I am supreme in this regard, in super-morality. There are some ascetics and Brahmins who preach self-mortification and scrupulous austerity, which they praise in various ways. But as regards the highest Ariyan self-mortification and austerity, Kassapa, I do not see any who have surpassed me in this. I am supreme in this regard, in super-austerity. There are some ascetics and Brahmins who preach wisdom. They praise wisdom in various ways. But as regards the highest Ariyan wisdom, Kassapa, I do not see any who have surpassed me in this. I am supreme in this regard, in super-wisdom. There are some ascetics and Brahmins who preach liberation. They praise liberation in various ways. But  as regards the highest Ariyan liberation, Kassapa, I do not see any who have surpassed me in this. I am supreme in this regard, in super-liberation. [175]</div>
<div class="fmtx1">22. ‘Kassapa, it may be that wanderers of other sects will say: “The ascetic Gotama roars his lion’s roar, but only in empty places, not in company.” They should be told that this is not true: “The ascetic Gotama roars his lion’s roar, and he roars it in company.” Or they may say: “The ascetic Gotama roars his lion’s roar, and in company, but he does so without confidence.” They should be told that this is not true: “The ascetic Gotama roars his lion’s roar, in company and confidently.” Or they may say: “The ascetic Gotama roars his lion’s roar, and in company, and confidently, but they do not question him.” They should be told that this is not true: “The ascetic Gotama roars his lion’s roar... and they question him.” Or they may say: “... and they question him, but he does not answer.” ... Or they may say: “ .. he answers, but he does not win them over with his answers.” ...Or they may say: “... but they don’t find it pleasing.” ... Or they may say: “... but they are not satisfied with what they have heard.” ... Or they may say: “... but they don’t behave as if they were satisfied.” ... Or they may say: “... but they are not on the path of truth.” ... Or they may say: “... but they are not satisfied with the practice.” They should be told that this is not true: “The ascetic Gotama roars his lion’s roar, in company and confidently, they question him and he answers, he wins them over with his answers, they find it pleasing and are satisfied with what they have heard, they behave as if they were satisfied, they are on the path of truth, and they are satisfied with the practice.” That, Kassapa, is what they should be told.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">23. ‘Once, Kassapa, I was staying at Rajagaha at the Vultures’ Peak. And a certain practiser of mortification [176] called Nigrodha consulted me about the practice of austerity.<a id="calibre_link-550" href="#calibre_link-2021" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">203</sup></a> And he was delighted with my explanation beyond all measure.’ ‘Lord, who on hearing Dhamma from you would fail to be delighted beyond all measure? I am delighted beyond all measure. Excellent, Lord, excellent! It is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down, or to point out the way to one who had got lost, or to bring an oil-lamp into a dark  place, so that those with eyes could see what was there. Just so the Blessed Lord has expounded the Dhamma in various ways. Lord, may I receive the going-forth at the Lord’s hands, may I receive ordination!’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">24. ‘Kassapa, whoever has formerly belonged to another sect and wishes for the going-forth or ordination in this Dhamma and discipline must wait four months, and at the end of four months’ probation, the monks who are established in mind will give him the going-forth and the monastic ordination. But there can be a distinction of persons in this.’ ‘Lord, if such is the case, I will even wait four years, and at the end of that time let the monks give me the going-forth and the monastic ordination.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Then Kassapa received the going- [177]-forth from the Lord himself, and the monastic ordination. And the newly-ordained Venerable Kassapa, alone, secluded, unwearying, zealous and resolute, in a short time attained that for which young men of good birth go forth from the household life into homelessness, that unexcelled culmination of the holy life, having realised it here and now by his own super-knowledge and dwelt therein knowing: ‘Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further here.’</div>

<div class="fmhT"><b class="calibre13"> 9 <i class="calibre8">Poṭṭhapāda Sutta: About Poṭṭhapāda</i></b></div>
<div class="cst"><b class="calibre5">States of Consciousness</b></div>
<div class="fmtx">[178] 1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. Once the Lord was staying at Savatthi, in Jeta’s grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika’s park. And at that time the wanderer Poṭṭhapāda was at the debating-hall near the Tinduka tree, in the single-halled park of Queen Mallikā,<a id="calibre_link-551" href="#calibre_link-2303" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">204</sup></a>  with a large crowd of about three hundred wanderers.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2. Then the Lord, rising early, took his robe and bowl and went to Sāvatthi for alms. But it occurred to him: ‘It is too early to go to Sāvatthi for alms. Suppose I were to go to the debating-hall to see the wanderer Poṭṭhapāda?’ And he did so.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">3. There Poṭṭhapāda was sitting with his crowd of wanderers, all shouting and making a great commotion, indulging in various kinds of unedifying conversation, such as about kings, robbers, ministers, armies, dangers, wars, food, drink, clothes, beds, garlands, perfumes, relatives, carriages, villages, towns and cities, [179] countries, women, heroes, street- and well-gossip, talk of the departed, desultory chat, speculations about land and sea, talk of being and non-being.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">4. But Poṭṭhapāda saw the Lord coming from a distance, and so he called his followers to order, saying: ‘Be quiet, gentlemen, don’t make a noise, gentlemen! That ascetic Gotama is coming, and he likes quiet and speaks in praise of quiet. If he sees that this company is quiet, he will most likely want to come and visit us.’ At this the wanderers fell silent.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">5. Then the Lord came to Poṭṭhapāda, who said: ‘Come, reverend Lord, welcome, reverend Lord! At last the reverend Lord has gone out of his way to come here. Be seated, Lord, a seat is prepared.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">The Lord sat down on the prepared seat, and Potthapada took a low stool and sat down to one side. The Lord said:  ‘Poṭṭhapāda, what were you all talking about? What conversation have I interrupted?’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">6. Poṭṭhapāda replied: ‘Lord, never mind the conversation we were having just now, it will not be difficult for the Lord to hear about that later. In the past few days, Lord, the discussion among the ascetics and Brahmins of various schools, sitting together and meeting in the debating-hall, has concerned [180] the higher extinction of consciousness,<a id="calibre_link-552" href="#calibre_link-2304" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">205</sup></a> and how this takes place. Some said: “One’s perceptions arise and cease without cause or condition. When they arise, one is conscious, when they cease, then one is unconscious.” That is how they explained it. But somebody else said: “No, that is not how it is. Perceptions<a id="calibre_link-553" href="#calibre_link-2305" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">206</sup></a> are a person’s self, which comes and goes. When it comes, one is conscious, when it goes, one is unconscious.” Another said: “That is not how it is. There are ascetics and Brahmins of great powers, of great influence. They draw down consciousness into a man and withdraw it. When they draw it down into him, he is conscious, when they withdraw it, he is unconscious.”<a id="calibre_link-554" href="#calibre_link-2306" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">207</sup></a> And another said: “No, that is not how it is. There are deities of great powers, of great influence. They draw down consciousness into a man and withdraw it. When they draw it down into him, he is conscious, when they withdraw it, he is unconscious.”<a id="calibre_link-555" href="#calibre_link-2307" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">208</sup></a> It was in this connection that I thought of the Lord: “Ah, surely, the Blessed Lord, the Well-Farer, he is supremely skilled<a id="calibre_link-556" href="#calibre_link-2308" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">209</sup></a> about these matters! The Blessed Lord well understands the higher extinction of consciousness.” What then, Lord, is this higher extinction of consciousness?’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">7. ‘In this matter, Poṭṭhapāda, those ascetics and Brahmins who say one’s perceptions arise and cease without cause or condition are totally wrong. Why is that? One’s perceptions arise and cease [181] owing to a cause and conditions. Some perceptions arise through training, and some pass away through training.’ ‘What is this training?’, the Lord said. ‘Potṭhapāda, a Tathāgata arises in this world an Arahant, fully-enlightened Buddha, endowed with wisdom and conduct, Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed, Teacher of gods and humans, enlightened and blessed. He, having realised it by his own super-knowledge,  proclaims this world with its devas, māras and Brahmās, its princes and people. He preaches the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its middle, lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and displays the fully-perfected and purified holy life. <i class="calibre9">A disciple goes forth and practises the moralities (Sutta 2, verses 41 &mdash; 62</i>). That for him is morality.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">8. ‘And then, Poṭṭhapāda, that monk who is perfected in morality sees no danger from any side... (<i class="calibre9">as Sutta</i> <i class="calibre9">2</i><i class="calibre9">, verse 63</i>). In this way he is perfected in morality.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">9 &mdash; 10. <i class="calibre9">He guards the sense-doors, etc.</i> (<i class="calibre9">Sutta 2, verses 64 &mdash; 75</i>). [182] Having reached the first jhāna, he remains in it. And whatever sensations of lust that he previously had disappear. At that time there is present a true but subtle perception of delight and happiness,<a id="calibre_link-557" href="#calibre_link-2309" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">210</sup></a> born of detachment, and he becomes one who is conscious of this delight and happiness. In this way some perceptions arise through training, and some pass away through training. And this is that training’, said the Lord.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">11. ‘Again, a monk, with the subsiding of thinking and pondering, by gaining inner tranquillity and unity of mind, reaches and remains in the second jhāna, which is free from thinking and pondering, born of concentration, filled with delight and happiness. His former true but subtle perception of delight and happiness born of detachment vanishes. At that time there arises a true but subtle perception [183] of delight and happiness born of concentration, and he becomes one who is conscious of this delight and happiness. In this way some perceptions arise through training, and some pass away through training.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">12. ‘Again, after the fading away of delight he dwells in equanimity, mindful and clearly aware, and he experiences in his body that pleasant feeling of which the Noble Ones say: “Happy dwells the man of equanimity and mindfulness”, and he reaches and remains in the third jhāna. His former true but subtle sense of delight and happiness born of concentration vanishes, and there arises at that time a true but subtle sense of equanimity and happiness, and he becomes one who is conscious of this true but subtle sense of equanimity and  happiness. In this way some perceptions arise through training, and some pass away through training.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">13. ‘Again, with the abandonment of pleasure and pain, and with the disappearance of previous joy and grief, he reaches and remains in the fourth jhana, a state beyond pleasure and pain, purified by equanimity and mindfulness. His former true but subtle sense of equanimity and happiness vanishes, and there arises a true but subtle sense of neither happiness nor unhappiness, and he becomes one who is conscious of this true but subtle sense of neither happiness nor unhappiness. In this way some perceptions arise through training, and some pass away through training.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">14. ‘Again, by passing entirely beyond bodily sensations, by the disappearance of all sense of resistance and by non-attraction to the perception of diversity, seeing that space is infinite, he reaches and remains in the Sphere of Infinite Space. In this way some perceptions arise through training, and some pass away through training.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">15. ‘Again, by passing entirely beyond [184] the Sphere of Infinite Space, seeing that consciousness is infinite, he reaches and remains in the Sphere of Infinite Consciousness. In this way some perceptions arise through training, and some pass away through training.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">16. ‘Again, by passing entirely beyond the Sphere of Infinite Consciousness, seeing that there is no thing, he reaches and remains in the Sphere of No-Thingness, and he becomes one who is conscious of this true but subtle perception of the Sphere of No-Thingness. In this way some perceptions arise through training, and some pass away through training. And this is that training’, said the Lord.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">17. ‘Potthapada, from the moment when a monk has gained this controlled perception,<a id="calibre_link-558" href="#calibre_link-2310" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">211</sup></a> he proceeds from stage to stage till he reaches the limit of perception. When he has reached the limit of perception it occurs to him: “Mental activity is worse for me, lack of mental activity is better. If I were to think and imagine,<a id="calibre_link-559" href="#calibre_link-2311" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">212</sup></a> these perceptions [that I have attained] would cease, and coarser perceptions would arise in me. Suppose I were not to think or imagine?” So he neither thinks nor imagines. And then, in him, just these perceptions arise, but  other, coarser perceptions do not arise. He attains cessation. And that, Poṭṭhapāda, is the way in which the cessation of perception is brought about by successive steps.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">18. ‘What do you think, Poṭṭhapāda? Have you heard of this before?’ ‘No, Lord. As I understand it, the Lord has said: “Poṭṭhapāda, from the moment when a monk has gained this controlled perception, he proceeds from stage to stage until he reaches the limit of perception... He attains cessation [185] ... and that is the way in which the cessation of perception is brought about by successive steps.”’ ‘That is right, Poṭṭhapāda.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">19. ‘Lord, do you teach that the summit of perception is just one, or that it is many?’ ‘I teach it as both one and many.’ ‘Lord, how is it one, and how is it many?’ ‘According as he attains successively to the cessation of each perception, so I teach the summit of that perception: thus I teach both one summit of perception, and I also teach many.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">20. ‘Lord, does perception arise before knowledge, or knowledge arise before perception, or do both arise simultaneously? ’ ‘Perception arises first, Poṭṭhapāda, then knowledge, and from the arising of perception comes the arising of knowledge. And one knows: “Thus conditioned, knowledge arises.” In this way you can see how perception arises first, and then knowledge, and that from the arising of perception comes the arising of knowledge.’<a id="calibre_link-560" href="#calibre_link-2312" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">213</sup></a></div>

You can see that in this way. Given such a gross self, certain perceptions would arise in a person, and others pass away. In this way you can see that perception must be one thing, the self another.’<a id="calibre_link-563" href="#calibre_link-2315" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">216</sup></a></div>
<div class="fmtx1">22. ‘Lord, I postulate a mind-made self complete with all its parts, not defective in any sense-organ.’<a id="calibre_link-564" href="#calibre_link-2316" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">217</sup></a> ‘But with such a mind-made self, perception would be one thing, and the self another...’ [187]</div>

<div class="fmtx1">24. ‘But Lord, is it possible for me to know whether perception is a person’s self, or whether perception is one thing, and self another?’ ‘Poṭṭhāpada, it is difficult for one of different views, a different faith, under different influences, with different pursuits and a different training to know whether these are two different things or not.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">25. ‘Well, Lord, if this question of self and perceptions is difficult for one like me &mdash; tell me: Is the world eternal?<a id="calibre_link-566" href="#calibre_link-2318" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">219</sup></a> Is only this true and the opposite false?’ ‘Poṭṭhapāda, I have not declared that the world is eternal and that the opposite view is false.’ ‘Well, Lord, is the world not eternal?’ ‘I have not declared that the world is not eternal...’ ‘Well, Lord, is the world infinite,... not infinite?...’ [188] ‘I have not declared that the world is not infinite and that the opposite view is false.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">26. ‘Well, Lord, is the soul the same as the body, ... is the soul one thing and the body another?’ ‘I have not declared that the soul is one thing and the body another.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">27. ‘Well, Lord, does the Tathāgata exist after death? Is only this true and all else false?’ ‘I have not declared that the Tathāgata exists after death.’ ‘Well, Lord, does the Tathāgata not exist after death,...both exist and not exist after death? ... neither exist nor not exist after death?’ ‘I have not declared that the Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death, and that all else is false.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">28. ‘But, Lord, why has the Lord not declared these things?’ ‘Poṭṭhāpada, that is not conducive to the purpose, not conducive to Dhamma, [189] not the way to embark on the holy life; it does not lead to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to calm, to higher knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna. That is why I have not declared it.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">29. ‘But, Lord, what has the Lord declared?’ ‘Poṭṭhapāda, I have declared: “This is suffering, this is the origin of suffering, this is the cessation of suffering, and this is the path leading to the cessation of suffering.”’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">30. ‘But, Lord, why has the Lord declared this?’ ‘Because, Poṭṭhapāda, this is conducive to the purpose, conducive to  Dhamma, the way to embark on the holy life; it leads to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to calm, to higher knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna. That is why I have declared it.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘So it is, Lord, so it is, Well-Farer. And now is the time for the Blessed Lord to do as he sees fit.’ Then the Lord rose from his seat and went away.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">31. Then the wanderers, as soon as the Lord had left, reproached, sneered and jeered at Poṭṭhapāda from all sides, saying: ‘Whatever the ascetic Gotama says, Poṭṭhapāda agrees with him: “So it is, Lord, so it is, Well-Farer!” <i class="calibre9">We</i> don’t understand a word of the ascetic Gotama’s whole discourse: “Is the world eternal or not? &mdash; Is it finite or infinite? &mdash; Is the soul the same as the body or different? &mdash; Does the Tathāgata exist after death or not, [190] or both, or neither?”’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Poṭṭhapāda replied: ‘I don’t understand either about whether the world is eternal or not...or whether the Tathāgata exists after death or not, or both, or neither. But the ascetic Gotama teaches a true and real way of practice which is consonant with Dhamma and grounded in Dhamma. And why should not a man like me express approval of such a true and real practice, so well taught by the ascetic Gotama?’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">32. Two or three days later, Citta, the son of the elephant-trainer, went with Poṭṭhāpada to see the Lord. Citta prostrated himself before the Lord and sat down to one side. Potthapada exchanged courtesies with the Lord, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. [191]</div>
<div class="fmtx1">33. ‘Poṭṭhapāda, all those wanderers are blind and sightless, you alone among them are sighted. Some things I have taught and pointed out, Poṭṭhāpada, as being certain, others as being uncertain. Which are the things I have pointed out as uncertain? “The world is eternal” I have declared to be uncertain... “The Tathāgata exists after death ...” Why? Because they are not conducive... to Nibbāna. That is why I have declared them as uncertain.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘But what things have I pointed out as certain? “This is suffering, [192] this is the origin of suffering, this is the cessation of suffering, this is the path leading to the cessation of suffering.” Why? Because they are conducive to the purpose, conducive  to Dhamma, the way to embark on the holy life; they lead to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to calm, to higher knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbana. That is why I have declared them as certain.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">34. ‘Poṭṭhapāda, there are some ascetics and Brahmins who declare and believe that after death the self is entirely happy and free from disease. I approached them and asked if this was indeed what they declared and believed, and they replied: “Yes.” Then I said: “Do you, friends, living in the world, know and see it as an entirely happy place?” and they replied: “No.” I said: “Have you ever experienced a single night or day, or half a night or day, that was entirely happy?” and they replied: “No.” I said: “Do you know a path or a practice whereby an entirely happy world might be brought about?” and they replied: “No.” I said: “Have you heard the voices of deities who have been reborn in an entirely happy world, saying: ‘The attainment of an entirely happy world has been well and rightly gained, and we, gentlemen, [193] have been reborn in such a realm’?” and they replied: “No.” What do you think, Poṭṭhapāda? Such being the case, does not the talk of those ascetics and Brahmins turn out to be stupid?</div>
<div class="fmtx1">35. ‘It is just as if a man were to say: “1 am going to seek out and love the most beautiful girl in the country.” They might say to him: “Well, as to this most beautiful girl in the country, do you know whether she belongs to the Khattiya, the Brahmin, the merchant or the artisan class?” and he would say: “No.” Then they might say: “Well, do you know her name, her clan, whether she is tall or short or of medium height, whether she is dark or light-complexioned or sallow-skinned, or what village or town or city she comes from?” and he would say: “No.” And they might say: “Well then, you don’t know or see the one you seek for and desire?” and he would say: “No.” Does not the talk of that man turn out to be stupid?’ ‘Certainly, Lord.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">36. ‘And so it is with those ascetics and Brahmins who declare and believe that after death the self is entirely happy and free from disease... [194] Does not their talk turn out to be stupid?’ ‘Certainly, Lord.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">37. ‘It is just as if a man were to build a staircase for a palace  at a crossroads. People might say to him: “Well now, this staircase for a palace that you are building &mdash; do you know whether the palace will face east, or west, or north or south, or whether it will be high, low or of medium height?” and he would say: “No.” And they might say: “Well then, you don’t know or see what kind of a palace you are building the staircase for?” and he would say: “No.” Don’t you think that man’s talk would turn out to be stupid?’ ‘Certainly, Lord.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">38. (<i class="calibre9">as verse</i> 34) [195]</div>
<div class="fmtx1">39. ‘Poṭṭhapāda, there are three kinds of “acquired self”:<a id="calibre_link-567" href="#calibre_link-2319" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">220</sup></a>  the gross acquired self, the mind-made acquired self, the formless acquired self. What is the gross acquired self? It has form, is composed of the four great elements, nourished by material food. What is the mind-made self? It has form, complete with all its parts, not defective in any sense-organ. What is the formless acquired self? It is without form, and made up of perception.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">40. ‘But I teach a doctrine for getting rid of the gross acquired self, whereby defiling mental states disappear and states tending to purification grow strong, and one gains and remains in the purity and perfection of wisdom here [196] and now, having realised and attained it by one’s own super-knowledge. Now, Poṭṭhāpada, you might think: “Perhaps these defiling mental states might disappear..., and one might still be unhappy.”<a id="calibre_link-568" href="#calibre_link-2320" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">221</sup></a> That is not how it should be regarded. If defiling states disappear..., nothing but happiness and delight develops, tranquillity, mindfulness and clear awareness &mdash; and that is a happy state.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">41. ‘I also teach a doctrine for getting rid of the mind-made acquired self...(<i class="calibre9">as verse</i> 40).</div>
<div class="fmtx1">42. ‘I also teach a doctrine for getting rid of the formless acquired self...(<i class="calibre9">as verse 40</i>). [197]</div>
<div class="fmtx1">43. ‘Poṭṭhapāda, if others ask us: “What, friend, is this gross acquired self whose abandonment you preach ... ?” being so asked, we should reply: “This <i class="calibre9">is</i><a id="calibre_link-569" href="#calibre_link-2321" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">222</sup></a> that gross acquired self for the getting rid of which we teach a doctrine...”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">44. ‘If others ask us: “What is this mind-made acquired self ...?” (<i class="calibre9">as verse 43</i>). [198]</div>
<div class="fmtx1">45. ‘If others ask us: “What is this formless acquired self  ...?” (<i class="calibre9">as verse 43</i>). What do you think, Poṭṭhapāda? Does not that statement turn out to be well-founded?’ ‘Certainly, Lord.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">46. ‘It is just as if a man were to build a staircase for a palace, which was below that palace. They might say to him: “Well now, this staircase for a palace that you are building, do you know whether the palace will face east or west, or north or south, or whether it will be high, low or of medium height?” and he would say: “This staircase is right under the palace.” Don’t you think that man’s statement would be well-founded?’ ‘Certainly, Lord.’ [199]</div>
<div class="fmtx1">47. ‘In just the same way, Poṭṭhapāda, if others ask us: “What is this gross acquired self...?” “What is this mind-made acquired self...?” “What is this formless acquired self ... ?” we reply: “This is this [gross, mind-made, formless] acquired self for the getting rid of which we teach a doctrine, whereby defiling mental states disappear and states tending to purification grow strong, and one gains and remains in the purity and perfection of wisdom here and now, having realised and attained it by one’s own super-knowledge.” Don’t you think that statement is well-founded?’ ‘Certainly, Lord.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">48. At this, Citta, son of the elephant-trainer, said to the Lord: ‘Lord, whenever the gross acquired self is present, would it be wrong to assume the existence of the mind-made acquired self, or of the formless acquired self? Does only the gross acquired self truly exist then? And similarly with the mind-made acquired self, and the formless acquired self?’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">49. ‘Citta, whenever the gross acquired self is present, we do not at that time speak of a mind-made acquired self, [200] we do not speak of a formless acquired self. We speak only of a gross acquired self.<a id="calibre_link-570" href="#calibre_link-2322" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">223</sup></a> Whenever the mind-made acquired self is present, we speak only of a mind-made acquired self, and whenever the formless acquired self is present, we speak only of a formless acquired self.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Citta, suppose they were to ask you: “Did you exist in the past or didn’t you, will you exist in the future or won’t you, do you exist now or don’t you?” how would you answer?’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Lord, if I were asked such a question, I would say: “I did exist in the past, I did not not exist; I shall exist in the future, I  shall not not exist; I do exist now, I do not not exist.” That, Lord, would be my answer.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">50. ‘But, Citta, if they asked: “The past acquired self that you had, is that your only true acquired self, and are the future and present ones false? Or is the one you will have in the future the only true one, and are the past and present ones false? Or is your present acquired self the only true one, and are the past and future ones false?” how would you reply?’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Lord, if they asked me these things, [201] I would reply: “My past acquired self was at the time my only true one, the future and present ones were false. My future acquired self will then be the only true one, the past and present ones will be false. My present acquired self is now the only true one, the past and future ones are false.” That is how I would reply.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">51. ‘In just the same way, Citta, whenever the gross acquired self is present, we do not at that time speak of a mind-made acquired self... [or] of a formless acquired self.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">52. ‘In just the same way, Citta, from the cow we get milk, from the milk curds, from the curds butter, from the butter ghee, and from the ghee cream of ghee. And when there is milk we don’t speak of curds, of butter, of ghee or of cream of ghee, we speak of milk; when there are curds we don’t speak of butter...; when there is cream of ghee... we speak of cream of ghee. [202]</div>
<div class="fmtx1">53. ‘So too, whenever the gross acquired self is present, we do not speak of the mind-made or formless acquired self; whenever the mind-made acquired self is present, we do not speak of the gross or formless acquired self; whenever the formless acquired self is present, we do not speak of the gross acquired self or the mind-made acquired self, we speak of the formless acquired self. But, Citta, these are merely names, expressions, turns of speech, designations in common use in the world, which the Tathāgata uses without misapprehending them.’<a id="calibre_link-571" href="#calibre_link-2323" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">224</sup></a></div>
<div class="fmtx1">54. And at these words Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer said to the Lord: ‘Excellent, Lord, excellent! It is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down, or to point out the way to one who had got lost, or to bring an oil-lamp into a dark  place, so that those with eyes could see what was there. Just so the Blessed Lord has expounded the Dhamma in various ways. Lord, I go for refuge to the Lord, the Dhamma and the Sangha. May the Lord accept me as a lay-follower who has taken refuge in him from this day forth as long as life shall last!’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">55. But Citta, son of the elephant-trainer, said to the Lord: ‘Excellent, Lord, excellent! It is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down, or to point out the way to one who had got lost, or to bring an oil-lamp into a dark place, so that those with eyes could see what was there. Just so the Blessed Lord has expounded the Dhamma in various ways. Lord, I go for refuge to the Lord, the Dhamma and the Sangha. May I, Lord, receive the going-forth at the Lord’s hands, may I receive ordination!’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">56. And Citta, son of the elephant-trainer, received the going-forth at the Lord’s hands, and the ordination. And the newly-ordained Venerable Citta, alone, secluded, unwearying, zealous and resolute, in a short time attained to that for the sake of which young men of good birth go forth from the household life into [203] homelessness, that unexcelled culmination of the holy life, having realised it here and now by his own super-knowledge and dwelt therein, knowing: ‘Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further here.’</div>
<div class="calibre3">&nbsp;<br class="calibre3" /></div><div class="fmtx">And the Venerable Citta, son of the elephant-trainer, became another of the Arahants.</div>

<div class="fmtx1">1.2. And Subha said to a certain young man: ‘Go, my lad, to where the ascetic Ananda is, ask him in my name if he is in good health, free from fatigue, strong, vigorous and dwelling in comfort, and say: “It would be good if the Reverend Ananda would, out of compassion, visit the dwelling of Subha the son of Todeyya.”’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.3 ‘Very good, sir’, replied the young man. Then he went to the Venerable Ananda, exchanged courtesies with him, and sat down to one side. Then he delivered [205] the message.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.4. The Venerable Ananda replied: ‘It is not the right time, young man. Today I have taken some medicine. Perhaps it will be possible to come tomorrow when the time and the occasion are suitable.’ And the young man rose, returned to Subha and reported what had passed between him and the Venerable Ananda, adding: ‘My mission has been thus far accomplished, that the Reverend Ananda will probably take the opportunity to come tomorrow.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.5. And indeed, as that night was ending, the Venerable Ananda dressed in the early morning, took his robe and bowl and, accompanied by the Venerable Cetaka,<a id="calibre_link-575" href="#calibre_link-2399" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">228</sup></a> came to Subha’s dwelling, and sat down on the prepared seat.

Then he said: [206] ‘The Reverend Ananda was for a long time the Reverend Gotama’s personal  attendant, dwelling in his presence and near him. You, Reverend Ananda, would know what things the Reverend Gotama praised, and with which he aroused, exhorted and established people. Which, Reverend Ananda, were those things?’</div>

He preaches the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its middle, lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and displays the fully-perfected and purified holy life. <i class="calibre9">A disciple goes forth and practises the moralities, etc.</i> (<i class="calibre9">Sutta 2, verses 41 &mdash; 63</i>).

<div class="cst"><b class="calibre5">What Brahma Didn’t Know</b></div>
<div class="fmtx">[211] 1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. Once the Lord was staying at Nālanda, in Pāvārika’s mango grove. And the householder Kevaddha  <a id="calibre_link-577" href="#calibre_link-2351" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">230</sup></a> came to the Lord, prostrated himself before him, and sat down to one side. He then said: ‘Lord, this Nāḷandā is rich, prosperous, populous, and full of people who have faith in the Lord. It would be well if the Lord were to cause some monk to perform superhuman feats and miracles. In this way Nāḷandā would come to have even more faith in the Lord.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">The Lord replied: ‘Kevaddha, this is not the way I teach Dhamma to the monks, by saying: “Go, monks, and perform superhuman feats and miracles for the white-clothed lay-people! ’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2. For a second time Kevaddha said: ‘Lord, I would not be importunate, but I still say: “This Nalanda is rich, prosperous ... [212] and would come to have even more faith in the Lord.”’ And the Lord replied as before.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">3. When Kevaddha repeated his request for a third time, the Lord said: ‘Kevaddha, there are three kinds of miracle that I have declared, having realised them by my own insight. Which three? The miracle of psychic power,<a id="calibre_link-578" href="#calibre_link-2352" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">231</sup></a> the miracle of telepathy,<a id="calibre_link-579" href="#calibre_link-2353" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">232</sup></a> the miracle of instruction.<a id="calibre_link-580" href="#calibre_link-2354" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">233</sup></a></div>
<div class="fmtx1">4. ‘What is the miracle of psychic power? Here, Kevaddha, a monk displays various psychic powers in different ways. Being one he becomes many, being many he becomes one... (<i class="calibre9">as Sutta 2, verse 87</i>) [213] and he travels in the body as far as the Brahma world. Then someone who has faith and trust sees him doing these things.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">5. ‘He tells this to someone else who is sceptical and unbelieving,  saying: “It is wonderful, sir, it is marvellous, the great power and skill of that ascetic ...” And that man might say: “Sir, there is something called the Gandhāra charm.<a id="calibre_link-581" href="#calibre_link-2355" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">234</sup></a> It is by means of this that that monk becomes many...” What do you think, Kevaddha, would not a sceptic say that to a believer?’ ‘He would, Lord.’ ‘And that is why, Kevaddha, seeing the danger of such miracles, I dislike, reject and despise them.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">6. ‘And what is the miracle of telepathy? Here, a monk reads the minds of other beings, of other people, reads their mental states, their thoughts and ponderings, and says: “That is how your mind is, that is how it inclines, that is in your heart.” Then someone who has faith and trust sees him doing these things.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">7. ‘He tells this to someone else who is sceptical and unbelieving, saying: “It is [214] wonderful, sir, it is marvellous, the great power and skill of that ascetic ...” And that man might say: “Sir, there is something called the Manika charm.<a id="calibre_link-582" href="#calibre_link-2356" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">235</sup></a> It is by means of this that that monk can read the minds of others ...” And that is why, seeing the danger of such miracles, I... despise them.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">8. ‘And what is the miracle of instruction? Here, Kevaddha, a monk gives instruction as follows: “Consider in this way, don’t consider in that, direct your mind this way, not that way, give up that, gain this and persevere in it.” That, Kevaddha, is called the miracle of instruction.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">9 &mdash; 66. ‘Again, Kevaddha, a Tathāgata arises in the world, an Arahant, fully-enlightened Buddha, endowed with wisdom and conduct, Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed, Teacher of gods and humans, enlightened and blessed. He, having realised it by his own super-knowledge, proclaims this world with its devas, māras and Brahmās, its princes and people.

<div class="fmtx1">67. ‘And I, Kevaddha, have experienced these three miracles by my own super-knowledge. Once, Kevaddha, in this order of monks the thought occurred to a certain monk: “I wonder where the four great elements &mdash; the earth element, the water element, the fire element, the air element &mdash; cease without remainder.” And that monk attained to such a state of mental concentration that the way to the deva-realms appeared before him.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">68. ‘Then, coming to the Realm of the devas of the Four Great Kings,<a id="calibre_link-584" href="#calibre_link-2358" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">237</sup></a> he asked those devas: “Friends, where do the four great elements -- earth, water, fire and air &mdash; cease without remainder?” At this question the devas of the Four Great Kings [216] said to him: “Monk, we don’t know where the four great elements cease without remainder. But the Four Great Kings are loftier and wiser than we are. They may know where the four great elements cease ... ”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">69. ‘So that monk went to the Four Great Kings and asked the same question, but they replied: “We don’t know, but the Thirty-Three Gods may know...”</div>

<div class="fmtx1">80. ‘Then that monk, by the appropriate concentration, made the way to the Brahmā world appear before him. He went to the devas of Brahmā’s retinue and asked them. They said: “We don’t know. But there is Brahmā, Great Brahmā, the Conqueror, the Unconquered, the All-Seeing, All-Powerful, the Lord, the Maker and Creator, the Ruler, Appointer and Orderer, Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be. He is loftier and wiser than we are. He would know where the four great elements cease without remainder.” “And where, friends, is this Great Brahmā now?” “Monk, we do not know when, how and where Brahmā will appear. But when the signs are seen &mdash; when a light appears and a radiance shines forth &mdash; then Brahmā will appear. Such signs are an indication that he will appear.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">81. ‘Then it was not long before the Great Brahmā [221] appeared. And that monk went up to him and said: “Friend, where do the four great elements &mdash; earth, water, fire, air &mdash; cease without remainder?” to which the Great Brahmā replied: “Monk, I am Brahmā, Great Brahmā, the Conqueror, the Unconquered, the All-Seeing, All-Powerful, the Lord, the Maker and Creator, the Ruler, Appointer and Orderer, Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">82. ‘A second time the monk said: “Friend, I did not ask if you are Brahmā, Great Brahmā ... I asked you where the four great elements cease without remainder.” And a second time the Great Brahmā replied as before.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">83. ‘And a third time the monk said: “Friend, I did not ask you that, I asked where the four great elements &mdash; earth, water, fire, air &mdash; cease without remainder.” Then, Kevaddha, the Great Brahmā took that monk by the arm, led him aside and [222] said: “Monk, these devas believe there is nothing Brahmā does not see, there is nothing he does not know, there is nothing he is unaware of. That is why I did not speak in front of them. But, monk, I don’t know where the four great elements  cease without remainder. And therefore, monk, you have acted wrongly, you have acted incorrectly by going beyond the Blessed Lord and going in search of an answer to this question elsewhere. Now, monk, you just go to the Blessed Lord and put this question to him, and whatever answer he gives, accept it.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">84. ‘So that monk, as swiftly as a strong man might flex or unflex his arm, vanished from the Brahma world and appeared in my presence. He prostrated himself before me, then sat down to one side and said: “Lord, where do the four great elements &mdash; the earth element, the water element, the fire element and the air element - cease without remainder?”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">85. ‘I replied: “Monk, once upon a time seafaring merchants, when they set sail on the ocean, took in their ship a land-sighting bird. When they could not see the land themselves, they released this bird. The bird flew to the east, to the south, to the west, to the north, it flew to the zenith and to the intermediate points of the compass. If it saw land anywhere, it flew there. But if it saw no land, it returned to the ship. In the same way, monk, you have been [223] as far as the Brahma world searching for an answer to your question and not finding it, and now you come back to me. But, monk, you should not ask your question in this way: ‘Where do the four great elements &mdash; the earth element, the water element, the fire element, the air element &mdash; cease without remainder?’ Instead, this is how the question should have been put:<div class="afmtx"><div class="fmtx2">‘Where do earth, water, fire and air no footing find?</div>
<div class="fmtx2">Where are long and short, small and great, fair and foul -</div>

</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx">And the answer is:<div class="afmtx"><div class="fmtx2">‘Where consciousness is signless,<a id="calibre_link-587" href="#calibre_link-2361" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">240</sup></a> boundless, all-luminous,  <a id="calibre_link-588" href="#calibre_link-2362" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">241</sup></a></div>

<div class="fmhT"><b class="calibre13">12 <i class="calibre8">Lohicca Sutta: About Lohicca</i></b></div>
<div class="cst"><b class="calibre5">Good and Bad Teachers</b></div>
<div class="fmtx">[224] 1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. Once the Lord was touring Kosala with a large company of some five hundred monks, and, coming to Sālavatikā, he stayed there. And at that time the Brahmin Lohicca was living at Sālavatikā, a populous place, full of grass, timber, water and corn, which had been given to him by King Pasenadi of Kosala as a royal gift and with royal powers.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2. Just then this evil line of reasoning occurred to Lohicca: ‘Suppose an ascetic or Brahmin were to discover some good doctrine?<a id="calibre_link-590" href="#calibre_link-1844" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">243</sup></a> having done so, he ought not to declare it to anyone else; for what can one man do for another? It is just as if a man, having cut through an old fetter, were to make a new one. I declare that such a thing is an evil deed rooted in attachment, for what can one man do for another?’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">3. Then Lohicca heard it said that the ascetic Gotama had arrived at Salavatika, and that concerning the Blessed Lord Gotama a good report had been spread about... (<i class="calibre9">as Sutta 4, verse</i> 2). [225] ‘And indeed it is good to see such Arahants.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">4. And Lohicca said to Bhesika the barber: ‘Friend Bhesika, go to the ascetic Gotama, ask in my name after his health and then say: “May the Reverend Gotama consent to take tomorrow’s meal, with his order of monks, from the Brahmin Lohicca!’”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">5. ‘Very good, sir’, said Bhesika, and carried out the errand. The Lord signified his acceptance by silence.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">6. Then Bhesika, understanding the Lord’s acceptance, rose from his seat and passed by with his right side to the Lord. He returned to Lohicca and told him [226] of the Lord’s acceptance.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">7. And Lohicca, as the night was ending, had choice hard and soft foods prepared at his own home. Then he sent Bhesika to tell the Lord that the meal was ready. And the Lord, having risen early and taken his robe and bowl, went with his order of monks to Sālavatikā.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">8. And Bhesika the barber followed the Lord close at hand. And he said: ‘Lord, this evil thought has occurred to the Brahmin Lohicca...Truly, Lord, this is what the Brahmin Lohicca has been thinking.’ ‘It may well be so, Bhesika, it may well be so.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">9. So the Lord came to Lohicca’s dwelling, and sat down on [227] the prepared seat. Lohicca personally served the Buddha and his order of monks with choice hard and soft food till they were contented and satisfied. When the Lord had taken his hand from the bowl, Lohicca took a low stool and sat down to one side. Then the Lord said to him: ‘Lohicca, is it true that an evil line of reasoning has occurred to you ... (as  <i class="calibre9">verse 2)?</i>’ ‘Yes, Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">10. ‘What do you think, Lohicca? Don’t you reside at Sālavatikā? ’ ‘Yes, Reverend Gotama.’ ‘Well now, if anyone should say: “The Brahmin Lohicca resides at Sālavatikā, and he should enjoy the entire fruits and revenues of Sālavatikā, not giving anything away to others” &mdash; would not anyone who spoke like that be a source of danger to your tenants?’ ‘He would be a source of danger, Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘And as such, would he be solicitous for their welfare or not?’ ‘He would not, Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘And, by not being solicitous for their welfare, would he have a heart full of love for them, or of hatred?’ ‘Of hatred, Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘And in a heart full of hatred, is there wrong view or right view?’ ‘Wrong view, Reverend Gotama,’ [228]</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘But Lohicca, I declare that wrong view leads to one of two destinies &mdash; hell or an animal rebirth.<a id="calibre_link-591" href="#calibre_link-1845" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">244</sup></a></div>
<div class="fmtx1">11. ‘What do you think, Lohicca? Does King Pasenadi of Kosala reside at Kāsi-Kosala?’ ‘He does, Reverend Gotama.’ ‘Well, if anyone should say: “King Pasenadi of Kosala resides at Kāsi-Kosala, and he should enjoy the entire fruits and revenues of Kosala, not giving anything away to others” &mdash; would  not anyone who spoke like that be a source of danger to his tenants? ... Would he not have a heart full of hatred ... and would that not be wrong view?’ ‘It would, Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">12. ‘Then surely, if anyone were to say the same of the Brahmin Lohicca ... that would be wrong view.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">13. ‘In the same way, Lohicca, if anyone should say: “Suppose an ascetic or Brahmin were to discover some good doctrine and thought he ought not to declare it to anyone else, [229] for what can one man do for another?” he would be a source of danger to those young men of good family who, following the Dhamma and discipline taught by the Tathāgata, attain to such excellent distinction as to realise the fruit of Stream-Entry, of Once-Returning, of Non-Returning, of Arahantship &mdash; and to all who ripen the seeds of a rebirth in the deva-world.<a id="calibre_link-592" href="#calibre_link-1846" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">245</sup></a> Being a source of danger to them, he is uncompassionate, and his heart is grounded in hostility, and that constitutes wrong view, which leads to ... hell or an animal rebirth.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">14. ‘And if anyone were to speak thus of King Pasenadi, he would be a source of danger to the King’s tenants, yourself and others...</div>
<div class="fmtx1">15. (<i class="calibre9">as verse 13)</i> [230]</div>
<div class="fmtx1">16. ‘Lohicca, these three kinds of teachers in the world are blameworthy, and if anyone blames such teachers, his blame is proper, true, in accordance with reality and faultless. Which three? Here, Lohicca, is a teacher who has gone forth from the household life into homelessness, but who has not gained the goal of asceticism. And without having gained this goal, he teaches his disciples a doctrine,<a id="calibre_link-593" href="#calibre_link-1847" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">246</sup></a> saying: “This is for your good, this is for your happiness.” But his pupils don’t wish to hear, they don’t listen, the don’t arouse the thought of enlightenment, and the teacher’s instructions are flouted. He should be blamed, saying: “This venerable one has gone forth ..., his instructions are flouted. It is just as if a man were to persist in making advances to a woman who rejected him, and to embrace her though she turned away.” This I declare to be an evil doctrine based on attachment, for what can one man do for another?<a id="calibre_link-594" href="#calibre_link-1848" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">247</sup></a> This is the first teacher who is blameworthy ...</div>
<div class="fmtx1">17. ‘Again, there is a teacher who has gone forth... but who has not gained the goal of asceticism. Without having gained this goal, he teaches his disciples a doctrine, saying: “This is for your good, this is for your happiness.” His pupils wish to hear, they listen, [231] they rouse the thought of enlightenment, and the teacher’s instructions are not flouted. He should be blamed, saying: “This venerable one has gone forth ...” It is as if, leaving his own field, he should think another’s field in need of weeding. I declare this to be an evil doctrine rooted in attachment...This is the second teacher who is blameworthy ...</div>
<div class="fmtx1">18. ‘Again, there is a teacher who has gone forth ... and who has gained the goal of asceticism. Having gone forth, he teaches ... But his pupils don’t wish to hear him, ... his instructions are flouted. He too should be blamed...Just as if, having cut through an old fetter, one were to make a new one, I declare that this is an evil doctrine rooted in attachment, for what can one man do for another? This is the third teacher who is blameworthy... [232] And these are the three kinds of teacher that I spoke of as blameworthy.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">19. Then Lohicca said: ‘Reverend Gotama, are there any teachers in the world who are not blameworthy?’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">20-55. ‘Here, Lohicca, a Tathāgata arises in the world, an Arahant, fully-enlightened Buddha, endowed with wisdom and conduct, Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed, Teacher of gods and humans, enlightened and blessed. He, having realised it by his own super-knowledge, proclaims this world with its devas, māras and Brahmas, its princes and people. He preaches the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its middle, lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and displays the fully-perfected and purified holy life. <i class="calibre9">A disciple goes forth and practises the moralities, guards the sense-doors, attains the first jhāna (Sutta 2, verses 41-76).</i> [233] And whenever the pupil of a teacher attains to such excellent distinction, that is a teacher who is not to be blamed in the world. And if anyone blames that teacher, his blame is improper, untrue, not in accordance with reality, and faulty.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">56-62. <i class="calibre9">‘He attains the other three jhānas (as Sutta 2, verses 77-</i>82)  <i class="calibre9">and various insights (Sutta 2, verses 83-84</i>). Whenever the pupil of a teacher attains to such excellent distinction, that is a teacher who is not to be blamed in the world...</div>
<div class="fmtx1">63-77. ‘<i class="calibre9">He realises the Four Noble Truths, the path, and the cessation of the corruptions ... (as Sutta 2, verses 85-97)</i></div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Whenever the pupil of a teacher attains to such excellent distinction, that is a teacher who [234] is not to be blamed in the world. And if anyone blames that teacher, his blame is improper, untrue, not in accordance with reality, and faulty.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">78. At this the Brahmin Lohicca said to the Lord: ‘Reverend Gotama, it is as if a man were to seize someone by the hair who had stumbled and was falling into a pit,<a id="calibre_link-595" href="#calibre_link-1849" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">248</sup></a> and to set him on firm ground &mdash; just so, I, who was falling into the pit, have been saved by the Reverend Gotama! Excellent, Reverend Gotama, excellent! It is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down, or to point out the way to one who had got lost, or to bring an oil-lamp into a dark place, so that those with eyes could see what was there. Just so the Reverend Gotama has expounded the Dhamma in various ways.’</div>
<div class="fmtx">‘I go for refuge to the Lord Gotama, the Dhamma and the Sangha. May the Reverend Gotama accept me as a lay-follower who has taken refuge from this day forth for as long as life shall last!’</div>

<div class="cst"><b class="calibre5">The Way to Brahma</b></div>
<div class="fmtx">[235] 1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. Once the Lord was touring Kosala with a large company of some five hundred monks. He came to a Kosalan Brahmin village called Manasakata, and stayed to the north of the village in a mango-grove on the bank of the River Aciravati.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2. And at that time many very well-known and prosperous Brahmins were staying at Manasakata, including Canki, Tārukkha, Pokkharasati, Jāṇussoni, and Todeyya.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">3. And Vasettha and Bharadvaja went strolling along the road, and as they did so, an argument broke out between them on the subject of right and wrong paths.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">4. The young Brahmin Vasettha said: ‘This is the only straight path, this is the direct path, the path of salvation that leads one who follows it to union with Brahma, as is taught by the Brahmin Pokkharasāti!’<a id="calibre_link-596" href="#calibre_link-1634" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">249</sup></a></div>
<div class="fmtx1">5. And the young Brahmin Bharadvaja said: ‘<i class="calibre9">This</i> is the only straight path... [236] as taught by the Brahmin Tarukkha!’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">6. And Vasettha could not convince Bharadvaja, nor could Bharadvaja convince Vasettha.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">7. Then Vasettha said to Bharadvaja: ‘This ascetic Gotama is staying to the north of the village, and concerning this Blessed Lord a good report has been spread about... (<i class="calibre9">as Sutta 4, verse</i>  2). Let us go to the ascetic Gotama and ask him, and whatever he tells us, we shall accept.’ And Bharadvaja agreed.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">8. So the two of them went to see the Lord. Having exchanged courtesies with him, they sat down to one side, and Vasettha said: ‘Reverend Gotama, as we were strolling along the road, we got to discussing right and wrong paths. I said: “This is the only straight path... as is taught by the Brahmin  Pokkharasati”, and Bhāradvāja said: “This <i class="calibre9">is</i> the only straight path...as is taught by the Brahmin Tārukkha.” This is our dispute, our quarrel, our difference.’ [237]</div>
<div class="fmtx1">9. ‘So, Vāseṭṭha, you say that the way to union with Brahmā is that taught by the Brahmin Pokkharasāti, and Bhāradvāja says it is that taught by the Brahmin Tārukha. What is the dispute, the quarrel, the difference all about?’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">10. ‘Right and wrong paths, Reverend Gotama. There are so many kinds of Brahmins who teach different paths: the Addhariya, the Tittiriya, the Chandoka, the Chandāva, the Brahmacariya  <a id="calibre_link-597" href="#calibre_link-1635" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">250</sup></a> Brahmins &mdash; do all these ways lead to union with Brahmā? Just as if there were near a town or village many different paths &mdash; do all these come together at that place? And likewise, do the ways of the various Brahmins...lead the one who follows them to union with Brahmā?’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">11. ‘You say: “They lead”, Vaseṭṭha?’ ‘I say: “They lead”, Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘You say: “They lead”, Vaseṭṭha?’ ‘I say: “They lead”, Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘You say: “They lead”, Vasettha?’ ‘I say: “They lead”, Reverend Gotama.’ [238]</div>
<div class="fmtx1">12. ‘But, Vāseṭṭha, is there then a single one of these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas who has seen Brahmā face to face?’ ‘No, Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Then has the teacher’s teacher of any one of them seen Brahmā face to face?’ ‘No, Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Then has the ancestor seven generations back of the teacher of one of them seen Brahmā face to face?’ ‘No, Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">13. ‘Well then, Vaseṭṭha, what about the early sages of those Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas, the makers of the mantras, the expounders of the mantras, whose ancient verses are chanted, pronounced and collected by the Brahmins of today, and sung and spoken about &mdash; such as Atthaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamataggi, Angirasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāsettha, Kassapa, Bhagu<a id="calibre_link-598" href="#calibre_link-1636" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">251</sup></a> - did they ever say: “We know and see when, how and where Brahmā appears”?’<a id="calibre_link-599" href="#calibre_link-1637" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">252</sup></a> ‘No, Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">14. ‘So, Vāseṭṭha, not one of these Brahmins learned in the  Three Vedas has seen Brahmā face to face, nor has one of their teachers, or teacher’s teachers, [239] nor even the ancestor seven generations back of one of their teachers. Nor could any of the early sages say: “We know and see when, how and where Brahmā appears.” So what these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas are saying is: “We teach this path to union with Brahmā that we do not know or see, this is the only straight path...leading to union with Brahmā.” What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? Such being the case, does not what these Brahmins declare turn out to be ill-founded?’ ‘Yes indeed, Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">15. ‘Well, Vāseṭṭha, when these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas teach a path that they do not know or see, saying: “This is the only straight path ... ”,this cannot possibly be right.

The talk of these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas turns out to be laughable, mere words, empty and vain.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">16. ‘What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? Do these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas see the sun and moon just as other people do, and when the sun and moon rise and set do they pray, sing praises and worship with clasped hands?’ ‘They do, Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">17. ‘What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? These Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas, who can see the sun and moon just as other people do, ... can they point out a way to union with the sun and moon, saying: “This is the only straight path... that leads to union with the sun and moon”?’ ‘No, Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">18. ‘So, Vāseṭṭha, these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas cannot point out a way to union with the sun and moon, which they have seen. And, too, none of them has seen Brahmā face to face,...[241] nor has even the ancestor seven generations back of one of their teachers. Nor could any of the early sages say: “We know and see when, how and where  Brahmā appears.” Does not what these Brahmins declare turn out to be ill-founded?’ ‘Yes indeed, Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">19. ‘Vaseṭṭha, it is just as if a man were to say: “I am going to seek out and love the most beautiful girl in the country.” They might say to him: “... Do you know what caste she belongs to?” “No.” “Well, do you know her [242] name, her clan, whether she is tall or short..., dark or light-complexioned..., or where she comes from?” “No.” And they might say: “Well then, you don’t know or see the one you seek for and desire?” and he would say: “No.” Does not the talk of that man turn out to be stupid?’ ‘Certainly, Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">20. ‘Then, Vāseṭṭha, it is like this: not one of these Brahmins ... has seen Brahmā face to face, nor has one of their teachers ...’ ‘Yes indeed, Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘That is right, Vāseṭṭha. When these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas [243] teach a path that they do not know and see, this cannot possibly be right.</div>

<div class="fmtx1">22 &mdash; 23. (<i class="calibre9">as verse 20</i>) [244]</div>
<div class="fmtx1">24. ‘Vāseṭṭha, it is just as if this River Aciravatī were brimful of water so that a crow could drink out of it, and a man should come along wishing to cross over, to get to the other side, to get across, and, standing on this bank, were to call out: “Come here, other bank, come here!” What do you think, Vasettha? Would the other bank of the River Aciravati come over to this side on account of that man’s calling, begging, requesting or wheedling?’ ‘No, Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">25. ‘Well now, Vasettha, those Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas who persistently neglect what a Brahmin should do, and persistently do what a Brahmin should not do, declare:  “We call on Indra, Soma, Varuna, Isana, Pajapati, Brahma, Mahiddhi, Yama.” But that such Brahmins who persistently [245] neglect what a Brahmin should do, ... will, as a consequence of their calling, begging, requesting or wheedling, attain after death, at the breaking-up of the body, to union with Brahmā &mdash; that is just not possible.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">26. ‘Vasettha, it is just as if this River Aciravati were brimful of water so that a crow could drink out of it, and a man should come wishing to cross over,... but he was bound and pinioned on this side by a strong chain, with his hands behind his back. What do you think, Vasettha? Would that man be able to get to the other side?’ ‘No, Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">27. ‘In just the same way, Vasettha, in the Ariyan discipline these five strands of sense-desire are called bonds and fetters. Which five? Forms seen by the eye which are agreeable, loved, charming, attractive, pleasurable, arousing desire; sounds heard by the ear... ; smells smelt by the nose ... ; tastes savoured by the tongue...; contacts felt by the body which are agreeable,... arousing desire. These five in the Ariyan discipline are called bonds and fetters. And, Vasettha, those Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas are enslaved, infatuated by these five strands of sense-desire, which they enjoy guiltily, unaware of danger, knowing no way out.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">28. ‘But that such Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas, who persistently neglect what a Brahmin should do,...[246] who are enslaved by these five strands of sense-desire, ... knowing no way out, should attain after death, at the breaking-up of the body, to union with Brahmā &mdash; that is just not possible.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">29. ‘It is just as if this River Aciravati were brimful of water so that a crow could drink out of it, and a man should come along wishing to cross over... and were to lie down on this bank, covering his head with a shawl. What do you think, Vasettha? Would that man be able to get to the other side?’ ‘No, Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">30. ‘In the same way, Vasettha, in the Ariyan discipline these five hindrances are called obstacles, hindrances, coverings-up, envelopings. Which five? The hindrance of sensuality, of ill-will, of sloth-and-torpor, of worry-and-flurry, of doubt.  These five are called obstacles, hindrances, coverings-up, envelopings. And these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas are caught up, hemmed in, obstructed, entangled in these five hindrances. But that such Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas, who persistently neglect what a Brahmin should do... and who are caught up,... entangled in these five hindrances, should attain after death, at the breaking-up of the body, [247] to union with Brahmā - that is just not possible.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">31. ‘What do you think, Vāsettha? What have you heard said by Brahmins who are venerable, aged, the teachers of teachers? Is Brahmā encumbered with wives and wealth,<a id="calibre_link-601" href="#calibre_link-1639" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">254</sup></a> or unencumbered?’ ‘Unencumbered, Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Is he full of hate or without hate?’ ‘Without hate, Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Is he full of ill-will or without ill-will?’ ‘Without ill-will, Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Is he impure or pure?’ ‘Pure, Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Is he disciplined<a id="calibre_link-602" href="#calibre_link-1640" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">255</sup></a> or undisciplined?’ ‘Disciplined, Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">32. ‘And what do you think, Vāsettha? Are the Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas encumbered with wives and wealth, or unencumbered?’ ‘Encumbered, Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Are they full of hate or without hate?’ ‘Full of hate, Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Are they full of ill-will or without ill-will?’ ‘Full of ill-will, Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Are they impure or pure?’ ‘Impure, Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Are they disciplined or undisciplined?’ ‘Undisciplined, Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">33. ‘So, Vāsettha, the Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas are encumbered with wives and wealth, and Brahmā is unencumbered. Is there any communion, anything in common between these encumbered Brahmins and the unencumbered Brahmā?’ ‘No, Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">34. ‘That is right, Vāsettha. That these encumbered Brahmins, learned in the Three Vedas, should after death, at the breaking-up of the body, [248] be united with the unencumbered Brahmā &mdash; that is just not possible.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">35. ‘Likewise, do these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas  and full of hate..., full of ill-will..., impure..., undisciplined, have any communion, anything in common with the disciplined Brahma?’ ‘No, Reverend Gotama.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">36. ‘That is right, Vasettha. That these undisciplined Brahmins should after death be united with Brahma is just not possible. But these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas, having sat down on the bank, sink down despairingly, thinking maybe to find a dry way across. Therefore their threefold knowledge is called the threefold desert, the threefold wilderness, the threefold destruction.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">37. At these words Vasettha said: ‘Reverend Gotama, I have heard them say: “The ascetic Gotama knows the way to union with Brahmā.”’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘What do you think, Vasettha? Suppose there were a man here born and brought up in Manasakata, and somebody who had come from Manasakata and [249] and had missed the road should ask him the way. Would that man, born and bred in Manasakata, be in a state of confusion or perplexity?’ ‘No, Reverend Gotama. And why not? Because such a man would know all the paths.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">38. ‘Vasettha, it might be said that such a man on being asked the way might be confused or perplexed &mdash; but the Tathagata, on being asked about the Brahma world and the way to get there, would certainly not be confused or perplexed. For, Vasettha, I know Brahma and the world of Brahma, and the way to the world of Brahma, and the path of practice whereby the world of Brahma may be gained.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">39. At this Vasettha said: ‘Reverend Gotama, I have heard them say: “The ascetic Gotama teaches the way to union with Brahma.” It would be good if the Reverend Gotama were to teach us the way to union with Brahma, may the Reverend Gotama help the people of Brahma!’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Then, Vāsettha, listen, pay proper attention, and I will tell you.’ ‘Very good, Reverend Sir’, said Vasettha. The Lord said:</div>
<div class="fmtx1">40 &mdash; 75. ‘Vasettha, a Tathagata arises in the world, an Arabant, fully-enlightened Buddha, endowed with wisdom and conduct, Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed, Teacher of gods and humans, enlightened and blessed. He, having realised it by his own super-knowledge,  proclaims this world with its devas, māras and Brahmas, its princes and people. He preaches the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its middle, lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and displays the fully-perfected and purified holy life.

<div class="fmtx1">76. ‘Then, with his heart filled with loving-kindness, he dwells suffusing one quarter, [251] the second, the third, the fourth.

<div class="fmtx1">77. ‘Just as if a mighty trumpeter were with little difficulty to make a proclamation to the four quarters, so by this meditation, Vasettha, by this liberation of the heart through loving-kindness he leaves nothing untouched, nothing unaffected in the sensuous sphere.<a id="calibre_link-604" href="#calibre_link-1642" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">257</sup></a> This, Vasettha, is the way to union with Brahma.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">78. ‘Then with his heart filled with compassion,... with sympathetic joy, with equanimity he dwells suffusing one quarter, the second, the third, the fourth. Thus he dwells suffusing the whole world, upwards, downwards, across, everywhere, always with a heart filled with equanimity, abundant, unbounded, without hate or ill-will.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">79. ‘Just as if a mighty trumpeter were with little difficulty to make a proclamation to the four quarters, so by this meditation, Vāsettha, by this liberation of the heart through compassion,... through sympathetic joy,... through equanimity, he leaves nothing untouched, nothing unaffected in the sensuous sphere. This, Vāsettha, is the way to union with Brahma.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">80. ‘What do you think, Vasettha? Is a monk dwelling thus encumbered with wives and wealth or unencumbered?’ ‘Unencumbered, Reverend Gotama. He is without hate..., without ill-will..., pure and disciplined, Reverend Gotama.’ [252]</div>
<div class="fmtx1">81. ‘Then, Vasettha, the monk is unencumbered, and Brahma is unencumbered. Has that unencumbered monk anything in common with the unencumbered Brahma?’ ‘Yes indeed, Reverend Gotama.’ </div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘That is right, Vāsettha. Then that an unencumbered monk, after death, at the breaking-up of the body, should attain to union with the unencumbered Brahmā &mdash; that is possible. Likewise a monk without hate..., without ill-will..., pure..., disciplined... Then that a disciplined monk, after death, at the breaking-up of the body, should attain to union with Brahmā &mdash; that is possible.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">82. At this the young Brahmins Vāsettha and Bhāradvāja said to the Lord: ‘Excellent, Reverend Gotama, excellent! It is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down, or to point out the way to one who had got lost, or to bring an oil-lamp into a dark place, so that those with eyes could see what was there. Just so the Reverend Gotama has expounded the Dhamma in various ways.’</div>
<div class="fmtx">‘We take refuge in the Reverend Gotama, in the Dhamma, and in the Sangha.

<div class="fmtx">[1] 1.1. THUS HAVE I HEARD.<a id="calibre_link-606" href="#calibre_link-1894" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">259</sup></a> Once the Lord was staying at Sāvatthi, in Anāthapindika’s park in the Jeta grove, in the Kareri hutment. And among a number of monks who had gathered together after their meal, after the alms-round, sitting in the Kareri pavilion, there arose a serious discussion on former lives, as they said: ‘This is how it was in a former life’, or ‘That was how it was.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.2. And the Lord, with the purified divine-ear faculty surpassing the powers of humans, heard what they were talking about. Getting up from his seat, he went to the Kareri pavilion, sat down on the prepared seat, and said: ‘Monks, what was your conversation as you sat together? What discussion did I interrupt?’ And they told him. [2]</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.3. ‘Well, monks, would you like to hear a proper discourse on past lives?’ ‘Lord, it is time for that! Well-Farer, it is time for that! If the Lord were to give a proper discourse on past lives, the monks would listen and remember it!’ ‘Well then, monks, listen, pay close attention, and I will speak.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Yes, Lord’, the monks replied, and the Lord said:</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.4. ‘Monks, ninety-one aeons ago the Lord, the Arahant, the fully-enlightened Buddha Vipassī arose in the world. Thirty-one aeons ago the Lord Buddha Sikhī arose; in the same thirty-first aeon before this Lord Buddha Vessabhū arose. And in this present fortunate aeon<a id="calibre_link-607" href="#calibre_link-1895" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">260</sup></a> the Lords Buddhas Kakusandha, Konagamana and Kassapa arose in the world. And, monks, in this present fortunate aeon I too have now arisen in the world as a fully-enlightened Buddha.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.5. ‘The Lord Buddha Vipassi was born of Khattiya race, and arose in a Khattiya family; the Lord Buddha Sikhi likewise;  [3] the Lord Buddha Vessabhū likewise; the Lord Buddha Kakusandha was born of Brahmin race, and arose in a Brahmin family; the Lord Buddha Konāgamana likewise; the Lord Buddha Kassapa likewise; and I, monks, who am now the Arahant and fully-enlightened Buddha, was born of Khattiya race, and arose in a Khattiya family.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.6. ‘The Lord Buddha Vipassi was of the Kondañña clan; the Lord Buddah Sikhī likewise; the Lord Buddah Vessabhū likewise; the Lord Buddha Kakusandha was of the Kassapa clan; the Lord Buddha Konagāmana likewise; the Lord Buddha Kassapa likwise; I who am now the Arahant and fully . enlightened Buddha, am of the Gotama clan.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.7. ‘In the time of the Lord Buddha Vipassi the life-span was eighty thousand years; in the time of the Lord Buddha Sikhi seventy thousand; in the time of the Lord Buddha Vessabhū sixty thousand; in the time of the Lord Buddha Kakusandhu forty thousand; in the time of the Lord Buddha Konāgamana thirty thousand; [4] in the time of the Lord Buddha Kassapa it was twenty thousand years. In my time the lifespan is short, limited and quick to pass: it is seldom that anybody lives to be a hundred.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.8. ‘The Lord Buddha Vipassi gained his full enlightenment at the foot of a trumpet-flower tree; the Lord Buddha Sikhi under a white-mango tree; the Lord Buddha Vessabhū under a <i class="calibre9">sāl</i>-tree; the Lord Buddha Kakusandha under an acacia-tree; the Lord Buddha Konāgamana under a fig-tree; the Lord Buddha Kassapa under a banyan-tree; and I became fully enlightened at the foot of an <i class="calibre9">assattha</i>-tree. <a id="calibre_link-608" href="#calibre_link-1896" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">261</sup></a></div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.9. ‘The Lord Buddha Vipassi had the pair of noble disciples Khanda and Tissa; the Lord Buddha Sikhi had Abhibhū and Sambhava; the Lord Buddha Vessabhū had Sona and Uttara; the Lord Buddha Kakusandha had Vidhūra and Sañjīva; the Lord Buddha Konāgamana had Bhiyyosa and Uttara; [5] the Lord Buddha Kassapa had Tissa and Bhāradvāja; I myself now have the pair of noble disciples Sāriputta and Moggallāna.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.10. ‘The Lord Buddha Vipassi had three assemblies of disciples: one of six million eight hundred thousand, one of a hundred thousand, and one of eighty thousand monks, and of these three assemblies all were Arahants; the Lord Buddha  Sikhi had three assemblies of disciples: one of a hundred thousand, one of eighty thousand, and one of seventy thousand monks &mdash; all Arahants; the Lord Buddha Vessabhū had three assemblies: one of eighty thousand, one of seventy thousand, and one of sixty thousand monks &mdash; all Arahants; the Lord Buddha Kakusandha had one assembly: forty thousand monks &mdash; all Arahants; the Lord Buddha Konagamana [6] had one assembly: thirty thousand monks &mdash; all Arahants; the Lord Buddha Kassapa had one assembly: twenty thousand monks &mdash; all Arahants; I, monks, have one assembly of disciples, one thousand two hundred and fifty monks, and this one assembly consists only of Arahants.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.11. ‘The Lord Buddha Vipassī’s personal attendant was the monk Asoka; the Lord Buddha Sikhī’s was Khemankara; the Lord Buddha Vessabhū’s was Upasannaka; the Lord Buddha Kakusandhu’s was Vuddhija; the Lord Buddha Konagamana’s was Sotthija; the Lord Buddha Kassapa’s was Sabbamitta; my chief personal attendant now is Ananda.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.12. ‘The Lord Buddha Vipassī’s father was King Bandhuma, [7] his mother was Queen Bandhumati, and King Bandhuma’s royal capital was Bandhumati. The Lord Buddha Sikhi’s father was King Aruna, his mother was Queen Pabhavati; King Aruna’s capital was Arunavatī. The Lord Buddha Vessabhū’s father was King Suppatita, his mother was Queen Yasavati; King Suppatīta’s capital was Anopama. The Lord Buddha Kakusandha’s father was the Brahmin Aggidatta, his mother was the Brahmin lady Visākhā. The king at that time was called Khema; his capital was Khemavati. The Lord Buddha Konagamana’s father was the Brahmin Yaññadatta, his mother was the Brahmin lady Uttara. The king at that time was Sobha; his capital was Sobhavati. The Lord Buddha Kassapa’s father was the Brahmin Brahmadatta, his mother was the Brahmin lady Dhanavati. The king at that time was Kiki; his capital was Vārānasī. And now, monks, my father was King Suddhodana, my mother was Queen Maya, and the royal capital was Kapilavatthu.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Thus the Lord spoke, and the Well-Farer then rose from his seat and went to his lodging. [8]</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.13. Soon after the Lord had gone, another discussion arose  among the monks:<a id="calibre_link-609" href="#calibre_link-1897" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">262</sup></a> ‘It is marvellous, friends, it is wonderful, the Tathāgata’s great power and ability &mdash; the way he recalls past Buddhas who have gained Parinibbāna, having cut away the hindrances, cut off the road [of craving], put an end to the round of becoming, overcome all suffering. He recalls their birth, their name, their clan, their life-span, the disciples and assemblies connected with him: “Being born thus, these Blessed Lords were such-and-such, such were their names, their clans, their discipline, their Dhamma, their wisdom, their liberation.” Well now, friends, how did the Tathagata come by the penetrative knowledge through which he remembers all this ... ? Did some deva reveal this knowledge to [9] him?’ This was the conversation of those monks which came to be interrupted.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.14. Then the Lord, rising from the seclusion of the rest-period, went to the Kareri pavilion and sat down on the prepared seat. He said: ‘Monks, what was your conversation as you sat together? What discussion did I interrupt?’ And the monks [10] told him.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.15. ‘The Tathāgata understands these things...by his own penetration of the principles of Dhamma; and devas, too, have told him. Well, monks, do you wish to hear still more [11] about past lives?’ ‘Lord, it is time for that! Well-Farer, it is time for that! If the Lord were to give a proper discourse on past lives, the monks would listen and remember it.’ ‘Well then, monks, listen, pay close attention, and I will speak.’ ‘Yes, Lord’, the monks replied, and the Lord said:</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.16. ‘Monks, ninety-one aeons ago the Lord, the Arahant, the fully-enlightened Buddha Vipassi arose in the world. He was born of Khattiya race, and arose in a Khattiya family. He was of the Kondañña clan. The span of his life was eighty thousand years. He gained his full enlightenment at the foot of a trumpet-flower tree. He had the pair of noble disciples Khanda and Tissa as his chief followers. He had three assemblies of disciples: one of six million eight hundred thousand, one of a hundred thousand, and one of eighty thousand monks, all Arahants. His chief personal attendant was the monk Asoka. His father was King Bandhumā, [12] his mother was Queen Bandhumatī. The king’s capital was Bandhumatī. </div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.17. <a id="calibre_link-610" href="#calibre_link-1898" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">263</sup></a>‘And so, monks, the Bodhisatta Vipassi descended from the Tusita heaven, mindful and clearly aware, into his mother’s womb.

<div class="fmtx1">‘It is the rule, monks, that when a Bodhisatta descends from the Tusita heaven into his mother’s womb, there appears in this world with its devas, māras and Brahmās, its ascetics and Brahmins, princes and people an immeasurable, splendid light surpassing the glory of the most powerful devas. And whatever dark spaces lie beyond the world’s end, chaotic, blind and black, such that they are not even reached by the mighty rays of sun and moon, are yet illumined by this immeasurable splendid light surpassing the glory of the most powerful devas. And those beings that have been reborn there<a id="calibre_link-612" href="#calibre_link-1900" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">265</sup></a> recognise each other by this light and know: “Other beings, too, have been born here!” And this ten-thousandfold world-system trembles and quakes and is convulsed.

<div class="fmtx1">‘It is the rule that when a Bodhisatta has entered his mother’s womb, four devas <a id="calibre_link-613" href="#calibre_link-1901" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">266</sup></a> come to protect him from the four quarters, saying: “Let no man, no non-human being, no thing whatever harm this Bodhisatta or this Bodhisatta’s mother!” That is the rule.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">i.i8. ‘It is the rule that when a Bodhisatta has entered his mother’s womb, his mother becomes by nature virtuous, refraining from taking life, from taking what is not given, from sexual [13] misconduct, from lying speech, or from strong drink and sloth-producing drugs. That is the rule.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.19. ‘It is the rule that when a Bodhisatta has entered his mother’s womb, she has no sensual thoughts connected with a man, and she cannot be overcome by any man with lustful thoughts. That is the rule.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.20. ‘It is the rule that when a Bodhisatta has entered his mother’s womb, she enjoys the fivefold pleasures of the senses and takes delight, being endowed and possessed of them. That is the rule.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.21. ‘It is the rule that when a Bodhisatta has entered his mother’s womb, she has no sickness of any kind, she is at ease and without fatigue of body, and she can see the Bodhisatta inside her womb, complete with all his members and  faculties. Monks, it is as if a gem, a beryl, pure, excellent, well cut into eight facets, clear, bright, flawless and perfect in every respect, were strung on a blue, yellow, red, white or orange cord. And a man with good eyesight, taking it in his hand, would describe it as such. Thus does the Bodhisatta’s mother, with no sickness, [14] see him, complete with all his members and faculties. That is the rule.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.22. ‘It is the rule that the Bodhisatta’s mother dies seven days after his birth and is reborn in the Tusita heaven. That is the rule.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.23. ‘It is the rule that whereas other women carry the child in their womb for nine or ten months before giving birth, it is not so with the Bodhisatta’s mother, who carries him for exactly ten months before giving birth. That is the rule.</div>

Why not? Because of the purity of both. In the same way the Bodhisatta issues forth stainless... [15] That is the rule.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.28. ‘It is the rule that when the Bodhisatta issues forth from his mother’s womb, two streams of water appear from the sky, one cold, the other warm, with which they ritually wash the Bodhisatta and his mother. That is the rule.</div>

Deign, Sire, to look at him.” The king looked at the prince and then said to the Brahmins skilled in signs: “You gentlemen are skilled in signs, examine the prince.” The Brahmins examined the prince, and said to King Bandhumā: “Sire, rejoice, for a mighty son has been born to you. It is a gain for you, Sire, it is a great profit for you, Sire, that such a son has been born into your family. Sire, this prince is endowed with the thirty-two marks of a Great Man. To such, only two courses are open. If he lives the household life he will become a ruler, a wheel-turning righteous monarch of the law, conqueror of the four quarters, who has established the security of his realm and is possessed of the seven treasures. These are: the Wheel Treasure, the Elephant Treasure, the Horse Treasure, the Jewel Treasure, the Woman Treasure, the Householder Treasure, and, as seventh, the Counsellor Treasure. He has more than a thousand sons who are heroes, of heroic stature, conquerors of the hostile army. He dwells having conquered this sea-girt land without stick or sword, by the law.

<div class="fmtx1">32. ‘From the time, Ananda, when a monk no longer regards feeling as the self, or the self as being impercipient, or as being percipient and of a nature to feel, by not so regarding, he clings to nothing in the world; not clinging, he is not excited  by anything, and not being excited he gains personal liberation,<a id="calibre_link-696" href="#calibre_link-2101" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">349</sup></a> and he knows: “Birth is finished, the holy life has been led, done was what had to be done, there is nothing more here.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘And if anyone were to say to a monk whose mind was thus freed: “The Tathāgata exists after death״,<a id="calibre_link-697" href="#calibre_link-2102" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">350</sup></a> that would be [seen by him as] a wrong opinion and unfitting, likewise: “The Tathāgata does not exist..., both exists and does not exist..., neither exists nor does not exist after death.” Why so? As far, Ananda, as designation and the range of designation reaches, as far as language and the range of language reaches, as far as concepts and the range of concepts reaches, as far as understanding and the range of understanding reaches, as far as the cycle reaches and revolves &mdash; that monk is liberated from all that by super-knowledge,<a id="calibre_link-698" href="#calibre_link-2103" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">351</sup></a> and to maintain that such a liberated monk does not know and see would be a wrong view and incorrect.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">33. ׳Ānanda, there are seven stations of consciousness<a id="calibre_link-699" href="#calibre_link-2104" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">352</sup></a>  and two realms.<a id="calibre_link-700" href="#calibre_link-2105" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">353</sup></a> Which are the seven? There are beings different in [69] body and different in perception, such as human beings, some devas and some in states of woe. That is the first station of consciousness. There are beings different in body and alike in perception, such as the devas of Brahmā׳s retinue, born there [on account of having attained] the first jhāna. That is the second station. There are beings alike in body and different in perception, such as the Abhassara devas.  <a id="calibre_link-701" href="#calibre_link-2106" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">354</sup></a> That is the third station. There are beings alike in body and alike in perception, such as the Subhakinna devas. That is the fourth station. There are beings who have completely transcended all perception of matter, by the vanishing of the perception of sense-reactions and by non-attention to the perception of variety; thinking: “Space is infinite”, they have attained to the Sphere of Infinite Space. That is the fifth station. There are beings who, by transcending the Sphere of Infinite Space, thinking: “Consciousness is infinite”, have attained to the Sphere of Infinite Consciousness. That is the sixth station. There are beings who, having transcended the Sphere of Infinite Consciousness, thinking: “There is no thing״, have attained to the Sphere of No-Thingness. That is the  seventh station of consciousness. [The two realms are:] The Realm of Unconscious Beings and, secondly, the Realm of Neither-Perception-Nor-Non-Perception.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">34. ‘Now, Ananda, as regards this first station of consciousness, with difference of body and difference of perception, as in the case of human beings and so on, if anyone were to understand it, its origin, its cessation, its attraction and its peril, and the deliverance from it, would it be fitting for him to take pleasure in it?’ [70] ‘No, Lord.’ ‘And as regards the other stations, and ‘.he two spheres likewise?’ ‘No, Lord.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Ananda, insofar as a monk, having known as they really are these seven stations of consciousness and these two spheres, their origin and cessation, their attraction and peril, is freed without attachment, that monk, Ananda, is called one who is liberated by wisdom.<a id="calibre_link-702" href="#calibre_link-2107" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">355</sup></a></div>

(6) By transcending the Sphere of Infinite Consciousness, thinking: “There is no thing״, one enters and abides in the Sphere of No-Thingness. That is the sixth. (7) By transcending the Sphere of No-Thingness, one reaches and abides in the Sphere of Neither-Perception-Nor-Non-Perception. That is the seventh.

<div class="fmtx1">36. ‘Ananda, when once a monk attains these eight liberations in forward order, in reverse order, and in forward-and-reverse order, entering them and emerging from them as and  when, and for as long as he wishes, and has gained by his own super-knowledge here and now both the destruction of the corruptions and the uncorrupted liberation of heart and liberation by wisdom,<a id="calibre_link-708" href="#calibre_link-2113" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">361</sup></a> that monk is called “both-waysliberatedʺ,  <a id="calibre_link-709" href="#calibre_link-2114" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">362</sup></a> and, Ananda, there is no other way of ʺboth-ways-liberationʺ that is more excellent or perfect than this.’</div>

THUS HAVE I HEARD.<a id="calibre_link-710" href="#calibre_link-2201" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">363</sup></a> Once the Lord was staying at Rajagaha on the mountain called Vultures’ Peak.<a id="calibre_link-711" href="#calibre_link-2202" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">364</sup></a> Now just then King Ajatasattu Vedehiputta<a id="calibre_link-712" href="#calibre_link-2203" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">365</sup></a> of Magadha wanted to attack the Vajjians.<a id="calibre_link-713" href="#calibre_link-2204" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">366</sup></a> He said: ‘I will strike the Vajjians who are so powerful and strong, I will cut them off and destroy them, I will bring them to ruin and destruction!’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.2. And King Ajatasattu said to his chief minister the Brahmin Vassakāra: ‘Brahmin, go to the Blessed Lord, worship him with your head to his feet in my name, ask if he is free from sickness or disease, if he is living at ease, vigorously and comfortably, and then say: “Lord, King Ajatasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha wishes to attack the Vajjians and says: ‘I will strike the Vajjians...,bring them to ruin and [73] destruction!ʹʺ And whatever the Lord declares to you, report that faithfully back to me, for Tathagatas never lie.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.3. ‘Very good, Sire’, said Vassakara and, having had the state carriages harnessed, he mounted one of them and drove in state from Rajagaha to Vultures’ Peak, riding as far as the ground would allow, then continuing on foot to where the Lord was. He exchanged courtesies with the Lord, then sat down to one side and delivered the King’s message.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.4. Now the Venerable Ānanda was standing behind the Lord, fanning him. And the Lord said: ‘Ananda, have you heard that the Vajjians hold regular and frequent assemblies?’ ‘I have heard, Lord, that they do.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">ʹĀnanda, as long as the Vajjians hold regular and frequent assemblies, they may be expected to prosper and not decline. Have you heard [74] that the Vajjians meet in harmony, break up in harmony, and carry on their business in harmony?ʹ ‘I have heard, Lord, that they do.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Ananda, as long as the Vajjians meet in harmony, break up in harmony, and carry on their business in harmony, they may be expected to prosper and not decline. Have you heard that the Vajjians do not authorise what has not been authorised already, and do not abolish what has been authorised, but proceed according to what has been authorised by their ancient tradition?’ ‘I have, Lord.ʹ...ʹHave you heard that they honour, respect, revere and salute the elders among them, and consider them worth listening to?... that they do not forcibly abduct others’ wives and daughters and compel them to live with them?... that they honour, respect, revere and salute the Vajjian shrines at home and abroad, not withdrawing the proper support made and given before?... [75] that proper provision is made for the safety of Arahants, so that such Arahants may come in future to live there, and those already there may dwell in comfort?’ ‘I have, Lord.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Ananda, so long as such proper provision is made,...the Vajjians may be expected to prosper and not decline.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.5. Then the Lord said to the Brahmin Vassakāra: ‘Once, Brahmin, when I was at the Sārandada Shrine in Vesālī, I taught the Vajjians these seven principles for preventing decline, and as long as they keep to these seven principles, as long as these principles remain in force, the Vajjians may be expected to prosper and not decline.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">At this, Vassakāra replied: ‘Reverend Gotama, if the Vajjians keep to even one of these principles, they may be expected to prosper and not [76] decline &mdash; far less all seven. Certainly the Vajjians will never be conquered by King Ajātasattu by force of arms, but only by means of propaganda<a id="calibre_link-714" href="#calibre_link-2205" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">367</sup></a> and setting them against one another. And now, Reverend Gotama, may I depart? I am busy and have much to do.’ ‘Brahmin, do as you think fit.’ Then Vassakāra, rejoicing and delighted at the Lord’s words, rose from his seat and departed.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.6. Soon after Vassakāra had gone, the Lord said: ‘Ananda, go to whatever monks there are round about Rājagaha, and summon them to the assembly hall.’ ‘Very good, Lord’, said Ananda, and did so. Then he came to the Lord, saluted him, stood to one side and said: ‘Lord, the order of monks is assembled. Now is the time for the Lord to do as he sees fit.’ Then the Lord rose from his seat, went to the assembly hall,  sat down on the prepared seat, and said: ‘Monks, I will teach you seven things that are conducive to welfare.<a id="calibre_link-715" href="#calibre_link-2206" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">368</sup></a> Listen, pay careful attention, and I will speak.’ ‘Yes, Lord’, said the monks, and the Lord said:</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘As long as the monks hold regular and frequent assemblies, they may be expected to prosper and not decline. As long as they meet in harmony, break up in harmony, and carry on their [77] business in harmony, they may be expected to prosper and not decline. As long as they do not authorise what has not been authorised already, and do not abolish what has been authorised, but proceed according to what has been authorised by the rules of training...; as long as they honour, respect, revere and salute the elders of long standing who are long ordained, fathers and leaders of the order...; as long as they do not fall prey to desires which arise in them and lead to rebirth...; as long as they are devoted to forest-lodgings...; as long as they preserve their personal mindfulness, so that in future the good among their companions will come to them, and those who have already come will feel at ease with them ...; as long as the monks hold to these seven things and are seen to do so, they may be expected to prosper and not decline.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.7. ‘I will tell you another seven things conducive to welfare... As long as monks do not rejoice, delight and become absorbed in works,<a id="calibre_link-716" href="#calibre_link-2207" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">369</sup></a>... in chattering,... in sleeping,...in company,...in evil desires,...in mixing and associating with evil friends,... as long as they do not rest content with partial achievements<a id="calibre_link-717" href="#calibre_link-2208" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">370</sup></a>...; as long as the monks hold to these seven things and are seen to do so, they may be expected to prosper and not decline.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.8. ‘I will tell you another seven things conducive to welfare... As long as monks continue with faith, with modesty, with fear of doing wrong, with learning, [79] with aroused vigour, with established mindfulness, with wisdom...</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.9. ‘I will tell you another seven things...As long as monks develop the enlightenment-factors of mindfulness, of investigation of phenomena, of energy, of delight, of tranquillity, of concentration, of equanimity...</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.10. ‘I will tell you another seven things... As long as monks  develop the perception of impermanence, of non-self, of impurity, of danger, of overcoming, of dispassion, of cessation, ... [80] they may be expected to prosper and not decline.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.11. ‘Monks, I will tell you six things that are conducive to communal living... As long as monks both in public and in private show loving-kindness to their fellows in acts of body, speech and thought,... share with their virtuous fellows whatever they receive as a rightful gift, including the contents of their alms-bowls, which they do not keep to themselves,... keep consistently, unbroken and unaltered those rules of conduct that are spotless, leading to liberation, praised by the wise, unstained and conducive to concentration, and persist therein with their fellows both in public and in private,... continue in that noble view that leads to liberation, to the utter destruction of suffering, remaining in such awareness with their fellows both in public and in private... [81] As long as monks hold to these six things and are seen to do so, they may be expected to prosper and not decline.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.12. And then the Lord, while staying at Vultures’ Peak, gave a comprehensive discourse: ‘This is morality, this is concentration, this is wisdom. Concentration, when imbued with morality, brings great fruit and profit. Wisdom, when imbued with concentration, brings great fruit and profit. The mind imbued with wisdom becomes completely free from the corruptions, that is, from the corruption of sensuality, of becoming, of false views and of ignorance.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.13. And when the Lord had stayed at Rājagaha as long as he wished, he said to the Venerable Ananda: ‘Come, Ananda, let us go to Ambalatthikā.’ ‘Very good, Lord’, said Ananda, and the Lord went there with a large company of monks.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.14. And the Lord stayed in the royal park at Ambalatthikā,  <a id="calibre_link-718" href="#calibre_link-2209" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">371</sup></a> and there he delivered a comprehensive discourse: ‘This is morality, this is concentration, this is wisdom...’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.15. Having stayed at Ambalatthikā as long as he wished, the Lord said to Ananda: ‘Let us go to Nāḷandāʹ, and they did so. At Nāḷandā the Lord stayed in Pāvārikaʹs mango-grove.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.16. Then the Venerable Sāriputta came to see the Lord, saluted him, [82] sat down to one side, and said: ‘It is clear to me, Lord, that there never has been, will be or is now another  ascetic or Brahmin who is better or more enlightened than the Lord.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘You have spoken boldly with a bull’s voice, Sāriputta, you have roared the lion’s roar of certainty! How is this? Have all the Arahant Buddhas of the past appeared to you, and were the minds of all those Lords open to you, so as to say: “These Lords were of such virtue, such was their teaching, such their wisdom, such their way, such their liberation”?’ ‘No, Lord.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘And have you perceived all the Arahant Buddhas who will appear in the future...?’ ‘No, Lord.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Well then, Sāriputta, you know me as the Arahant Buddha, and do you know: “The Lord is of such virtue, such is his teaching, such his wisdom, such his way, such his liberation”?’ ‘No, Lord.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘So, Sāriputta, you do not have knowledge of the minds of the Buddhas of the past, the future or the present. Thus, Sāriputta, [83] have you not spoken boldly with a bull’s voice and roared the lion’s roar of certainty with your declaration?’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.17. ‘Lord, the minds of the Arahant Buddhas of the past, future and present are not open to me. But I know the drift of the Dhamma.<a id="calibre_link-719" href="#calibre_link-2210" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">372</sup></a> Lord, it is as if there were a royal frontier city, with mighty bastions and a mighty encircling wall in which was a single gate, at which was a gatekeeper, wise, skilled and clever, who kept out strangers and let in those he knew. And he, constantly patrolling and following along a path, might not see the joins and clefts in the bastion, even such as a cat might creep through. But whatever larger creatures entered or left the city, must all go through this very gate. And it seems to me, Lord, that the drift of the Dhamma is the same. All those Arahant Buddhas of the past attained to supreme enlightenment by abandoning the five hindrances, defilements of mind that weaken the understanding, having firmly established the four foundations of mindfulness in their minds, and realised the seven factors of enlightenment as they really are. All the Arahant Buddhas of the future will do likewise, and you, Lord, who are now the Arahant, fully-enlightened Buddha, have done the same.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.18. Then, while staying at Nāḷandā, [84] in Pāvārikaʹs mango-grove, the Lord gave a comprehensive discourse to the monks.  ‘This is morality, this is concentration, this is wisdom...’ (<i class="calibre9">as verse 12).</i></div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.19. And having stayed at Nāḷandā as long as he wished, the Lord said to Ananda: ‘Let us go to Pāṭaligāma.ʹ And they did so.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.20. At Pāṭaligāma they heard say: ‘The Lord has arrived here’. And the lay-followers of Pāṭaligāma came to the Lord, saluted him, sat down to one side, and said: ʹMay the Lord consent to stay at our rest-house!’ And the Lord consented by silence.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.21. Understanding his consent, they rose from their seats, saluted the Lord and, passing him by to the right, went to the rest-house and strewed the floor, prepared seats, provided a water-pot and filled the oil-lamp. Then they went to the Lord, saluted him, stood to one side and said: ʹAll is ready at the rest-house, Lord. Now is the time to do as the Lord wishes.’ [85]</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.22. Then the Lord dressed, took his robe and bowl, and went with his monks to the rest-house, where he washed his feet, went in and sat down facing east, with his back against the central pillar. And the monks, having washed their feet, went in and sat down with their backs to the west wall, facing east, and with the Lord sitting in front of them. And the lay-followers of Pāṭaligāma, having washed their feet, went in and sat down with their backs to the east wall, facing west and with the Lord before them.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.23. Then the Lord addressed the lay-followers of Pāṭaligāma: ʹHouseholders, there are these five perils to one of bad morality, of failure in morality. What are they? In the first place, he suffers great loss of property through neglecting his affairs. In the second place, he gets a bad reputation for immorality and misconduct. In the third place, whatever assembly he approaches, whether of Khattiyas, Brahmins, householders or ascetics, he does so diffidently and shyly. In the fourth place, he dies confused. In the fifth place, after death, at the breaking-up of the body, he arises in an evil state, a bad fate, in suffering and hell. These are the five perils to one of bad morality.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">[86] 1.24. ‘And, householders, there are these five advantages  to one of good morality and of success in morality. What are they? In the first place, through careful attention to his affairs he gains much wealth. In the second place, he gets a good reputation for morality and good conduct. In the third place, whatever assembly he approaches, whether of Khattiyas, Brahmins, householders or ascetics, he does so with confidence and assurance. In the fourth place, he dies unconfused. In the fifth place, after death, at the breaking-up of the body, he arises in a good place, a heavenly world. These are the five advantages to one of good morality, and of success in morality. ʹ</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.25. Then the Lord instructed, inspired, fired and delighted the lay-followers of Pataligama with talk on Dhamma until far into the night. Then he dismissed them, saying: ʹHouseholders, the night is nearly over. Now it is time for you to do as you think fit.’ ‘Very good, Lord’, they said and, rising and saluting the Lord, they passed him by to the right and departed. And the Lord spent the remainder of the night in the rest-house left empty by their departure.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.26. Now at this time Sunidha and Vassakara, the Magadhan ministers, were building a fortress in Pataligama as a defence against the Vajjians. And at that time a multitude of [87] thousands of devas were taking up lodging in Pataligama. And in the parts where powerful devas settled, they caused the minds of the most powerful royal officials to pick those sites for their dwellings, and where middle and lower-ranking devas settled, so too they caused the minds of royal officials of corresponding grade to pick those sites for their dwellings.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.27. And the Lord, with his divine eye surpassing that of humans, saw the thousands of devas taking up residence in Pataligama. And, getting up at break of day, he said to the Venerable Ananda: ‘Ananda, who is building a fortress at Pataligama?’ ‘Lord, Sunidha and Vassakāra, the Magadhan ministers, are building a fortress against the Vajjians.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.28. ʹĀnanda, just as if they had taken counsel with the Thirty-Three Gods, Sunidha and Vassakāra are building a fortress at Pātaligāma. I have seen with my divine eye how thousands of devas were taking up lodging there... (<i class="calibre9">as verse</i>  26). Ānanda, as far as the Ariyan realm extends, as far as its  trade extends, this will be the chief city, Pāṭaliputta, scattering its seeds far and [88] wide. And Pātaliputta will face three perils: from fire, from water and from internal dissension.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.29. Then Sunidha and Vassakāra called on the Lord and, having exchanged courtesies, stood to one side and said: ʹMay the Reverend Gotama accept a meal from us tomorrow with his order of monks!’ And the Lord consented by silence.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.30. Understanding his consent, Sunidha and Vassakāra went home and there had a fine meal of hard and soft food prepared. When it was ready, they reported to the Lord: ‘Reverend Gotama, the meal is ready.’ Then the Lord, having dressed in the morning, took his robe and bowl, went with the order of monks to the residence of Sunidha and Vassakāra, and sat down on the prepared seat. Then Sunidha and Vassakāra served the Buddha and his order of monks with choice soft and hard foods till they were satisfied. And when the Lord took his hand away from the bowl they sat down on low stools to one side.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.31. And as they sat there, the Lord thanked them with these verses:<div class="afmtx"><div class="fmtx2">‘In whatever realm the wise man makes his home, <br class="calibre6" />He should feed the virtuous leaders of the holy life.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">Whatever devas there are who report this offering, <br class="calibre6" />They will pay him respect and honour for this. [89]</div>
<div class="fmtx2">They tremble for him as a mother for her son, <br class="calibre6" />And he for whom devas tremble ever happy is.’</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx">Then the Lord rose from his seat and took his departure.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.32. Sunidha and Vassakāra followed closely behind the Lord, saying: ‘Whichever gate the ascetic Gotama goes out by today, that shall be called the Gotama gate; and whichever ford he uses to cross the Ganges, that shall be called the Gotama ford.’ And so the gate by which the Lord went out was called the Gotama Gate.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.33. And then the Lord came to the River Ganges. And just then, the river was so full that a crow could drink out of it. And some people were looking for a boat, and some were looking for a raft, and some were binding together a raft of  reeds to get to the other side. But the Lord, as swiftly as a strong man might stretch out his flexed arm or flex it again, vanished from this side of the Ganges and reappeared with his order of monks on the other shore.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.34. And the Lord saw those people who were looking for a boat, looking for a raft, and binding together a raft of reeds to get to the other side. And seeing their intentions, he uttered this verse on the spot:<div class="afmtx"><div class="fmtx2">‘When they want to cross the sea, the lake or pond,</div>
<div class="fmtx2">People make a bridge or raft &mdash; the wise have crossed already.’</div>

Then the Lord addressed the monks thus: ‘Monks, it is through not understanding, not penetrating the Four Noble Truths that I as well as you have for a long time run on and gone round the cycle of birth-and-death. What are they? By not understanding the Noble Truth of Suffering we have fared on, by not understanding the Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering, of the Cessation of Suffering, and of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering we have fared on round the cycle of birth-and-death. And by the understanding, the penetration of the same Noble Truth of Suffering, of the Origin of Suffering, of the Cessation of Suffering and of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering, the craving for becoming has been cut off, the support of becoming has been destroyed, there is no more re-becoming.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.3. The Lord having said this, the Well-Farer having spoken, the Teacher said: [91]<div class="afmtx"><div class="fmtx2">‘Not seeing the Four Noble Truths as they are, <br class="calibre6" />Having long traversed the round from life to life, <br class="calibre6" />These being seen, becoming’s supports pulled up, <br class="calibre6" />Sorrow’s root cut off, rebirth is done.’</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.4. Then the Lord, while staying at Koṭigāma, gave a comprehensive discourse: ‘This is morality, this is concentration, this is wisdom. Concentration, when imbued with morality, brings great fruit and profit. Wisdom, when imbued with concentration, brings great fruit and profit. The mind imbued with wisdom becomes completely free from the corruptions, that is, from the corruption of sensuality, of becoming, of false views and of ignorance.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.5. When the Lord had stayed at Koṭigāma as long as he wished, he said: ‘Ananda, let us go to Nādikā.’ ‘Very good, Lord’, said Ananda, and the Lord went with a large company of monks to Nādikā, where he stayed at the Brick House.<a id="calibre_link-720" href="#calibre_link-2211" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">373</sup></a></div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.6. And the Venerable Ananda came to the Lord, saluted him, sat down to one side, and said: ‘Lord, the monk Sāḷha and the nun Nandā have died at Nadikā. What rebirth have they taken after death? [92] The lay-follower Sudatta and the laywoman-follower Sujātā, the lay-followers Kakudha, Kalinga, Nikata, Katissabha, Tuttha, Santuttha, Bhadda and Subhadda have all died in Nādikā. What rebirths have they taken?’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.7. ‘Ananda, the monk Sāḷha, by the destruction of the corruptions, attained in this life, through his own super-knowledge, the uncorrupted liberation of mind, the liberation by wisdom. The nun Nandā, by the destruction of the five lower fetters, has been spontaneously reborn,<a id="calibre_link-721" href="#calibre_link-2212" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">374</sup></a> and will gain Nibbana from that state without returning to this world. The lay-follower Sudatta, by the destruction of three fetters and the reduction of greed, hatred and delusion, is a Once-Returner who will come back once more to this world, and then make an end of suffering. The laywoman-follower Suj̣̣ātā, by the destruction of three fetters, is a Stream-Winner, incapable of falling into states of woe, certain of attaining Nibbāna. The lay-follower Kakudha, by the destruction of the five lower fetters, has been spontaneously reborn, and will gain Nibbāna from that state without returning to this world. Likewise Kālinga, Nikata, Katissabha, Tuttha, Santuttha, Bhadda and Subhadda. [93] Ananda, in Nādikā more than fifty lay-followers have by the destruction of the five lower fetters been spontaneously reborn, and will gain Nibbāna from that state without returning to this world. Rather more than ninety, by the  destruction of three fetters and the reduction of greed, hatred and delusion, are Once-Returners who will come back once more to this world and then make an end of suffering. And well over five hundred, by the destruction of three fetters, are Stream-Winners, incapable of falling into states of woe, certain of attaining Nibbāna.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.8. ‘Ānanda, it is not remarkable that that which has come to be as a man should die. But that you should come to the Tathāgata to ask the fate of each of those who have died, that is a weariness to him.<a id="calibre_link-722" href="#calibre_link-2213" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">375</sup></a> Therefore, Ananda, I will teach you a way of knowing Dhamma, called the Mirror of Dhamma,<a id="calibre_link-723" href="#calibre_link-2214" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">376</sup></a>  whereby the Ariyan disciple, if he so wishes, can discern of himself: “I have destroyed hell, animal-rebirth, the realm of ghosts, all downfall, evil fates and sorry states.

<div class="fmtx1">2.9. ‘And what is this Mirror of Dhamma by which he can know this? Here, Ananda, this Ariyan disciple is possessed of unwavering confidence<a id="calibre_link-724" href="#calibre_link-2215" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">377</sup></a> in the Buddha, thus: “This Blessed Lord is an Arahant, a fully-enlightened Buddha, endowed with wisdom and conduct, the Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed, Teacher of gods and humans, enlightened and blessed.” He is possessed of unwavering faith in the Dhamma, thus: “Well-proclaimed by the Lord is the Dhamma, visible here and now, timeless, inviting inspection, leading onward, to be comprehended by the wise each one for himself.” He is possessed of unwavering confidence in the Sangha, thus: ʺWell-directed is the Sangha of the Lord’s disciples, of upright conduct, on the right [94] path, on the perfect path; that is to say the four pairs of persons,<a id="calibre_link-725" href="#calibre_link-2216" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">378</sup></a> the eight kinds of humans. The Sangha of the Lord’s disciples is worthy of offerings, worthy of hospitality, worthy of gifts, worthy of veneration, an unsurpassed field of merit in the world. And he<a id="calibre_link-726" href="#calibre_link-2217" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">379</sup></a> is possessed of morality dear to the Noble Ones, unbroken, without defect, unspotted, without inconsistency,<a id="calibre_link-727" href="#calibre_link-2218" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">380</sup></a> liberating, uncorrupted, and conducive to concentration.</div>

<div class="fmtx1">2.10. Then the Lord, staying at Nādikā in the Brick House, gave a comprehensive discourse to the monks: ‘This is morality, this is concentration, this is wisdom...’ (<i class="calibre9">as verse 2.4).</i></div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.11. And when the Lord had stayed at Nādikā as long as he wished,...he went with a large company of monks to Vesali, where he stayed at Ambapālīʹs grove.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.12. And there the Lord addressed the monks: ‘Monks, a monk should be mindful and clearly aware, this is our charge to you!</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘And how is a monk mindful?<a id="calibre_link-728" href="#calibre_link-2219" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">381</sup></a> Here, a monk abides contemplating the body as body,<a id="calibre_link-729" href="#calibre_link-2220" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">382</sup></a> earnestly, clearly aware, [95] mindful and having put away all hankering and fretting for the world, and likewise with regard to feelings, mind and mind-objects. That is how a monk is mindful.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.13. ‘And how is a monk clearly aware? Here, a monk, when going forward or backward, is aware of what he is doing; in looking forward or back he is aware of what he is doing; in bending and stretching he is aware of what he is doing; in carrying his inner and outer robe and bowl he is aware of what he is doing; in eating, drinking, chewing and savouring he is aware of what he is doing; in passing excrement or urine he is aware of what he is doing; in walking, standing, sitting or lying down, in keeping awake, in speaking or in staying silent, he is aware of what he is doing. That is how a monk is clearly aware. A monk should be mindful and clearly aware, this is our charge to you!’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.14. Now Ambapali the courtesan<a id="calibre_link-730" href="#calibre_link-2221" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">383</sup></a> heard that the Lord had arrived at Vesālī and was staying at her grove. She had the best carriages made ready and drove from Vesālī to her park. She drove as far as the ground would allow, then alighted and went on foot to where the Lord was. She saluted the Lord and sat down to one side, and as she sat, the Lord instructed, inspired, fired and delighted her with a talk on Dhamma. And being thus delighted, Ambapālī said: ‘Lord, may the Lord consent to take a meal from me tomorrow with his order of  monks!’ The Lord consented by silence, and Ambapālī, understanding his acceptance, rose from her seat, saluted the Lord and, passing him by to the right, departed.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.15. And the Licchavis of Vesālī heard that the Lord [96] had arrived at Vesālī and was staying at Ambapālīʹs grove. So they had the best carriages made ready and drove out of Vesālī. And some of the young Licchavis were all in blue,<a id="calibre_link-731" href="#calibre_link-2222" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">384</sup></a> with blue make-up,<a id="calibre_link-732" href="#calibre_link-2223" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">385</sup></a> blue clothes and blue adornment, while some were in yellow, some in red, some in white, with white make-up, white clothes and white adornment.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.16. And Ambapālī met the young Licchavis axle to axle, wheel to wheel, yoke to yoke. And they said to her: ʹAmbapālī, why do you drive up against us like that?’ ‘Because, young sirs, the Blessed Lord has been invited by me for a meal with his order of monks.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Ambapālī, give up this meal for a hundred thousand pieces!’ ‘Young sirs, if you were to give me all Vesālī with its revenues  <a id="calibre_link-733" href="#calibre_link-2224" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">386</sup></a> I would not give up such an important meal!’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Then the Licchavis snapped their fingers, saying: ‘We’ve been beaten by the mango-woman,<a id="calibre_link-734" href="#calibre_link-2225" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">387</sup></a> we’ve been cheated by the mango-woman!’ And they set out for Ambapālīʹs grove.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.17. And the Lord, having seen the Licchavis from afar, said: ‘Monks, any of you who have not seen the Thirty-Three Gods, just look at this troop of Licchavis! Take a good look at them, [97] and you will get an idea of the Thirty-Three Gods!’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.18. Then the Licchavis drove in their carriages as far as the ground would allow, then they alighted and went on foot to where the Lord was, saluted him and sat down to one side. And as they sat, the Lord instructed, inspired, fired and delighted them with a talk on Dhamma. And being thus delighted, they said: ‘Lord, may the Lord consent to take a meal from us tomorrow with his order of monks!’ ‘But, Licchavis, I have already accepted a meal for tomorrow from the courtesan Ambapālī! ’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">And the Licchavis snapped their fingers, saying: ‘We’ve been beaten by the mango-woman, we’ve been cheated by the mango-woman!’ Then, having rejoiced and delighted in his talk, they rose from their seats, saluted the Lord and, passing him by on the right, departed.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.19. And Ambapālī, when night was nearly over, having had choice hard and soft food prepared at her home, announced to the Lord that the meal was ready. Having dressed and taken robe and bowl, the Lord went with the order of monks to Ambapālīʹs residence and sat down on the prepared seat. And she served the Buddha and his monks with choice hard and soft food till they were satisfied. And when the Lord had taken his hand from the bowl, Ambapālī took a low stool and [98] sat down to one side. So seated, she said: ‘Lord, I give this park to the order of monks with the Buddha as its head.’ The Lord accepted the park, and then he instructed, inspired, fired and delighted her with a talk on Dhamma, after which he rose from his seat and departed.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.20. Then, while staying at Vesālī, the Lord delivered a comprehensive discourse to the monks: ‘This is morality, this is concentration, this is wisdom...’ <i class="calibre9">(as verse 2.4).</i></div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.21. And when the Lord had stayed at Ambapālīʹs grove as long as he wished,...he went with a large company of monks to the little village of Beluva, where he stayed.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.22. There the Lord said to the monks: ‘You, monks, should go to anywhere in Vesālī where you have friends or acquaintances or supporters, and spend the Rains there. I shall spend the Rains here in Beluva.ʹ ʹVery good, Lord’, replied the monks, and [99] they did so, but the Lord spent the Rains in Beluva.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.23. And during the Rains the Lord was attacked by a severe sickness, with sharp pains as if he were about to die. But he endured all this mindfully, clearly aware and without complaining. He thought: ‘It is not fitting that I should attain final Nibbāna without addressing my followers and taking leave of the order of monks. I must hold this disease in check by energy and apply myself to the force of life.’ He did so, and the disease abated.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.24. Then the Lord, having recovered from his sickness, as soon as he felt better, went outside and sat on a prepared seat in front of his dwelling. Then the Venerable Ananda came to him, saluted him, sat down to one side and said: ‘Lord, I have seen the Lord in comfort, and I have seen the Lord’s patient enduring. And, Lord, my body was like a drunkard’s. I lost my bearings and things were unclear to me because of the  Lord’s sickness. The only thing that was some comfort to me was the thought: “The Lord will not attain final Nibbana until he has made some statement about the order of monks.ʺʹ [100]</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.25. ‘But, Ananda, what does the order of monks expect of me?

So why should the Tathagata make a statement about the order?</div>
<div class="fmtx1">ʹĀnanda, I am now old, worn out, venerable, one who has traversed life’s path, I have reached the term of life, which is eighty.<a id="calibre_link-737" href="#calibre_link-2228" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">390</sup></a> Just as an old cart is made to go by being held together with straps,<a id="calibre_link-738" href="#calibre_link-2229" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">391</sup></a> so the Tathagata’s body is kept going by being strapped up.

<div class="fmtx1">2.26. ‘Therefore, Ananda, you should live as islands<a id="calibre_link-742" href="#calibre_link-2233" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">395</sup></a> unto yourselves, being your own refuge, with no on else as your refuge, with the Dhamma as an island, with the Dhamma as your refuge, with no other refuge. And how does a monk live as an island unto himself,... with no other refuge? Here, Ānanda, a monk abides contemplating the body as body, earnestly, clearly aware, mindful and having put away all hankering and fretting for the world, and likewise with regard to feelings, mind and mind-objects.

<div class="fmtx1">3.2. Then the Lord came to the Cāpāla Shrine, and sat down on the prepared seat. Ānanda saluted the Lord and sat down to one side, and the Lord said: ‘Ananda, Vesālī is delightful, the Udena Shrine is delightful, the Gotamaka Shrine is delightful, the Sattambaka<a id="calibre_link-744" href="#calibre_link-2235" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">397</sup></a> Shrine is delightful, the Bahuputta<a id="calibre_link-745" href="#calibre_link-2236" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">398</sup></a>  Shrine is delightful, the Cāpāla Shrine is delightful.

<div class="fmtx1">3.4. But the Venerable Ananda, failing to grasp this broad hint, this clear sign, did not beg the Lord: ‘Lord, may the Blessed Lord stay for a century, may the Well-Farer stay for a century for the benefit and happiness of the multitude, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit and happiness of devas and humans’, so much was his mind possessed by Māra.<a id="calibre_link-748" href="#calibre_link-2239" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">401</sup></a></div>

<div class="fmtx1">3.7. Soon after Ananda had left, Māra the Evil One came to the Lord, stood to one side, and said: ‘Lord, may the Blessed Lord now attain final Nibbāna, may the Well-Farer now attain final Nibbāna.

<div class="fmtx1">3.9. At this the Lord said to Māra: ‘You need not worry, Evil One. The Tathāgataʹs final passing will not be long delayed. Three months from now, the Tathāgata will take final Nibbana.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">3.10. So the Lord, at the Cāpāla Shrine, mindfully and in full awareness renounced the life-principle, and when this occurred there was a great earthquake, terrible, hair-raising and accompanied by thunder.

<div class="fmtx1">3.11. And the Venerable Ananda thought: ‘It is marvellous, it is wonderful how this great earthquake arises, this terrible earthquake, so dreadful and hair-raising, accompanied by thunder! Whatever can have caused it?’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">3.12. He went to the Lord, saluted him, sat down to one side, and asked him that question.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">3.13. ʹĀnanda, there are eight reasons, eight causes for the appearance of a great earthquake. This great earth is established  on water, the water on the wind, the wind on space.

<div class="fmtx1">3.21. ʹĀnanda, these eight [kinds of] assemblies. What are they?

And I instructed, inspired, fired and delighted them with a discourse on Dhamma. And as I spoke with them they did not know me and wondered: “Who is it that speaks like this &mdash; a deva or a man?” And having thus instructed them, I disappeared, and still they did not know: “He who has just disappeared &mdash; was he a deva or a man?”</div>

<div class="fmtx1">4.4. Then the Lord, while staying at Bhaṇḍagāma, delivered a comprehensive discourse: ‘This is morality, this is concentration,  this is wisdom.

The mind imbued with wisdom becomes completely free from the corruptions, that is, from the corruption of sensuality, of becoming, of false views and of ignorance.’</div>

Then, without approving or disapproving, his words and expressions should be carefully noted and compared with the Suttas and reviewed in the light of the discipline. If they, on such comparison and review, are found not to conform to the Suttas or the discipline, the conclusion must be: “Assuredly this is not the word of the Buddha, it has been wrongly understood by this monk”, and the matter is to be rejected. But where on such comparison and review they are found to conform to the Suttas or the discipline, the conclusion must be: “Assuredly this is the word of the Buddha, it has been rightly understood by this monk.” This is the first criterion.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">4.9. ‘Suppose a monk were to say: “In such and such a place there is a community with elders and distinguished teachers.

<div class="fmtx1">4.13. And when the Lord had stayed at Bhoganagara for as long as he wished, he said: ‘Ananda, let us go to Pāvā.’ ‘Very good, Lord’, said Ananda, and the Lord went with a large company of monks to Pāvā, where he stayed at the mango-grove of Cunda the smith.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">4.14. And Cunda heard that the Lord had arrived at Pāvā and was staying at his mango-grove. So he went to the Lord, saluted him and sat down to one side, and the Lord instructed, inspired, fired and delighted him with a talk on Dhamma.</div>

<div class="fmtx1">4.19. Then the Lord said to Cunda: ‘Whatever is left over of the “pig’s delight” you should bury in a pit, because, Cunda,  I can see none in this world with its devas, māras and Brahmās, in this generation with its ascetics and Brahmins, its princes and people who, if they were to eat it, could thoroughly digest it except the Tathāgata.’<a id="calibre_link-765" href="#calibre_link-2256" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">418</sup></a> ‘Very good, Lord’, said Cunda and, having buried the remains of the ‘pig’s delight’ in a pit, he came to the Lord, saluted him and sat down to one side.

<div class="fmtx1">4.20. And after having eaten the meal provided by Cunda, the Lord was attacked by a severe sickness with bloody diarrhoea, and with sharp pains as if he were about to die.

<div class="atx"><div class="fmtx2">Having eaten Cunda’s meal (this I’ve heard), <br class="calibre6" />He suffered a grave illness, painful, deathly; <br class="calibre6" />From eating a meal of ‘pig’s delight’ <br class="calibre6" />Grave sickness assailed the Teacher. <br class="calibre6" />Having purged, the Lord then said: <br class="calibre6" />‘Now I’ll go to Kusinārā town.’<a id="calibre_link-766" href="#calibre_link-2257" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">419</sup></a></div>

<div class="fmtx1">4.22. The Lord sat down on the prepared seat and said: ‘Ananda, bring me some water: I am thirsty and want to drink.’ Ananda replied: ‘Lord, five hundred carts have passed this way. The water is churned up by their wheels and is not good, it is dirty and disturbed. But, Lord, the River Kakutthā nearby has clean water, [129] pleasant, cool, pure, with beautiful banks, delightful. There the Lord shall drink the water and cool his limbs.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">4.23. A second time the Lord said: ‘Ananda, bring me some water...’, and Ananda replied as before.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">4.24. A third time the Lord said: ‘Ananda, bring me some water: I am thirsty and want to drink.’ ‘Very good, Lord’, said Ānanda and, taking his bowl, he went to the stream. And that  stream whose water had been churned up by the wheels and was not good, dirty and disturbed, as Ananda approached it began to flow pure, bright and unsullied.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">4.25. And the Venerable Ananda thought: ‘Wonderful, marvellous are the Tathagata’s great and mighty powers! This water was churned up by wheels..., and at my approach it flows pure, bright and unsullied!’ He took water in his bowl, brought it to the Lord and told him of his thought, saying:  <i class="calibre9">‘</i>May the Lord drink the water, may the Well-Farer drink!’ And the Lord drank the water.

<div class="fmtx1">4.27. ‘Once, Lord, Ālāra Kālāma was going along the main road and, turning aside, he went and sat down under a nearby tree to take his siesta. And five hundred carts went rumbling by very close to him. A man who was walking along behind them came to Āḷāra Kālāma and said: “Lord, did you not see five hundred carts go by?” “No, friend, I did not.” “But didn’t you hear them, Lord?” “No, friend, I did not.” “Well, were you asleep, Lord?” “No, friend, I was not asleep.” “Then, Lord, were you conscious?” “Yes, friend”. “So, Lord, being conscious and awake you neither saw nor heard five hundred carts passing close by you, even though your outer robe was bespattered with dust?” “That is so, friend.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘And that man thought: “It is wonderful, it is marvellous! These wanderers are so calm that though conscious [131] and awake, a man neither saw nor heard five hundred carts passing close by him!” And he went away praising Āḷāra Kālāma’s lofty powers.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">4.28. ‘Well, Pukkusa, what do you think? What do you consider is more difficult to do or attain to - while conscious and awake not to see or hear five hundred carts passing nearby or, while conscious and awake, not to see or hear anything when the rain-god streams and splashes, when lightning flashes and thunder crashes?’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">4.29. ‘Lord, how can one compare not seeing or hearing five hundred carts with that - or even six, seven, eight, nine or ten hundred, or hundreds of thousands of carts to that? To see or hear nothing when such a storm rages is more difficult...’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">4.30. ‘Once, Pukkusa, when I was staying at Atuma, at the threshing-floor, the rain-god streamed and splashed, lightning flashed and thunder crashed, and two farmers, brothers, and four oxen were killed. And a lot of people went out of Atuma to where the two brothers and the four oxen were killed.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">4.31. ‘And, Pukkusa, I had at that time gone out of the door of the threshing-floor and was walking up and down outside. And a man from the crowd came to me, saluted me and stood to one side. And I said to him:</div>
<div class="fmtx1">4.32. ‘“Friend, why are all these people gathered here?” [132] “Lord, there has been a great storm and two farmers, brothers, and four oxen have been killed. But you, Lord, where have you been?” “I have been right here, friend.” “But what did you see, Lord?” “I saw nothing, friend.” “Or what did you hear, Lord?” “I heard nothing, friend.” “Were you sleeping, Lord?” “I was not sleeping, friend.” “Then, Lord, were you conscious?” “Yes, friend.” “So, Lord, being conscious and awake you neither saw nor heard the great rainfall and floods and the thunder and lightning?” “That is so, friend.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">4.33. ‘And, Pukkusa, that man thought: “It is wonderful, it is marvellous! These wanderers are so calm that they neither see nor hear when the rain-god streams and splashes, lightning flashes and thunder crashes!” Proclaiming my lofty powers, he saluted me, passed by to the right and departed.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">4.34. At this, Pukkusa the Malla said: ‘Lord, I reject the lofty powers of Āḷāra Kalama as if they were blown away by a mighty wind or carried off by a swift stream or river! Excellent, Lord, excellent! It is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down, or to point out the way to one who had got lost, or to bring an oil lamp into a dark place, so that those with eyes could see what was there. Just so the Blessed Lord has expounded the Dhamma in various ways. [133] And I, Lord, go for refuge to the Blessed Lord, the Dhamma and the Sangha. May the Blessed Lord accept me from this day forth as a lay-follower as long as life shall last!’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">4.35. Then Pukkusa said to one man: ‘Go and fetch me two fine sets of robes of cloth-of-gold, burnished and ready to wear.’ ‘Yes, Lord’, the man replied, and did so. And Pukkusa offered the robes to the Lord, saying: ‘Here, Lord, are two fine sets of robes of cloth-of-gold. May the Blessed Lord be graciously pleased to accept them!’ ‘Well then, Pukkusa, clothe me in one set and Ananda in the other.’ ‘Very good, Lord’, said Pukkusa, and did so.<a id="calibre_link-768" href="#calibre_link-2259" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">421</sup></a></div>
<div class="fmtx1">4.36. Then the Lord instructed, inspired, fired and delighted Pukkusa the Malla with a talk on Dhamma. Then Pukkusa rose from his seat, saluted the Lord, passed by to the right, and departed.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">4.37. Soon after Pukkusa had gone, Ānanda, having arranged one set of the golden robes on the body of the Lord, observed that against the Lord’s body it appeared dulled. And he said: ‘It is wonderful, Lord, it is marvellous how clear and bright the Lord’s skin appears! It looks even brighter than the golden [134] robes in which it is clothed.’ ‘Just so, Ananda. There are two occasions on which the Tathāgata’s skin appears especially clear and bright. Which are they? One is the night in which the Tathāgata gains supreme enlightenment, the other is the night when he attains the Nibbāna-element without remainder at his final passing. On these two occasions the Tathāgata’s skin appears especially clear and bright.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">4.38. ‘Tonight, Ananda, in the last watch, in the <i class="calibre9">sāl</i>-grove of the Mallas near Kusinārā, between two <i class="calibre9">sāl</i>-trees, the Tathāgata’s final passing will take place. And now, Ananda, let us go to the River Kakutthā.’ ‘Very good, Lord’, said Ānanda.<a id="calibre_link-769" href="#calibre_link-2260" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">422</sup></a></div>
<div class="atx"><div class="fmtx2">Two golden robes were Pukkusa’s offering: <br class="calibre6" />Brighter shone the Teacher’s body than its dress.</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx1">4.39. Then the Lord went with a large number of monks to the River Kakutthā. He entered the water, bathed and drank and, emerging, went to the mango grove, where he said to the Venerable Cundaka: ‘Come, Cundaka, fold a robe in four for me. I am tired and want to lie down.’ ‘Very good, Lord’, said Cundaka, and did so.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">4.40. Then the Lord adopted the lion-posture, lying on his  right side, placing one foot on the other, mindfully and with clear awareness [135] bearing in mind the time of awakening. And the Venerable Cundaka sat down in front of the Lord.</div>
<div class="atx"><div class="fmtx2">4.41. The Buddha having gone to Kakutthā the river <br class="calibre6" />With its clear, bright and pleasant waters, <br class="calibre6" />Therein the Teacher plunged his weary body. <br class="calibre6" />Tathāgata - without an equal in the world. <br class="calibre6" />Surrounded by the monks whose head he was. <br class="calibre6" />The Teacher and Lord, Preserver of Dhamma, <br class="calibre6" />To the Mango Grove the great Sage went, <br class="calibre6" />And to Cundaka the monk he said: <br class="calibre6" />‘On a fourfold robe I’ll lie down.’ <br class="calibre6" />And thus adjured by the great Adept, <br class="calibre6" />Cundaka placed the fourfold robe. <br class="calibre6" />The Teacher laid his weary limbs to rest <br class="calibre6" />While Cundaka kept watch beside him.</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx1">4.42. Then the Lord said to the Venerable Ananda: ‘It might happen, Ananda, that Cunda the smith should feel remorse, thinking: “It is your fault, friend Cunda, it is by your misdeed that the Tathāgata gained final Nibbāna after taking his last meal from you!” But Cunda’s remorse should be expelled in this way: “That is your merit, Cunda, that is your good deed, that the Tathāgata gained final Nibbāna after taking his last meal from you! For, friend Cunda, I have heard and understood from the Lord’s own lips that these two alms-givings are of very great [136] fruit, of very great result, more fruitful and advantageous than any other. Which two? The one is the alms-giving after eating which the Tathāgata attains supreme enlightenment, the other that after which he attains the Nibbana-element without remainder at his final passing. These two alms-givings are more fruitful and profitable than all others. Cunda’s deed is conducive to long life, to good looks, to happiness, to fame, to heaven and to lordship.” In this way, Ananda, Cunda’s remorse is to be expelled.’</div>
<div class="calibre3">&nbsp;<br class="calibre3" /></div><div class="fmtx1">4.43. Then the Lord, having settled this matter, at that time uttered this verse: <div class="afmtx"><div class="fmtx2">‘By giving, merit grows, by restraint, hatred’s checked. <br class="calibre6" />He who’s skilled abandons evil things. <br class="calibre6" />As greed, hate and folly wane, Nibbāna’s gained.’</div>

<div class="calibre3">&nbsp;<br class="calibre3" /></div><div class="calibre3">&nbsp;<br class="calibre3" /></div><div class="fmtx">[137] 5.1. The Lord said: ‘Ānanda, let us cross the Hiraññavatī River and go to the Mallas’ <i class="calibre9">sāl</i>-grove in the vicinity of Kusinārā. ’<a id="calibre_link-770" href="#calibre_link-2261" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">423</sup></a> ‘Very good, Lord’, said Ananda, and the Lord, with a large company of monks, crossed the river and went to the  <i class="calibre9">sāl</i>-grove<i class="calibre9">.</i> There the Lord said: ‘Ananda, prepare me a bed between these twin <i class="calibre9">sāl</i>-trees with my head to the north. I am tired and want to lie down.’ ‘Very good, Lord’, said Ananda, and did so. Then the Lord lay down on his right side in the lion-posture, placing one foot on the other, mindful and clearly aware.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">5.2. And those twin <i class="calibre9">sāl</i>-trees burst forth into an abundance of untimely blossoms, which fell upon the Tathāgata’s body, sprinkling it and covering it in homage. Divine coral-tree flowers fell from the sky, divine sandal-wood powder fell from the sky, sprinkling and covering the Tathāgata’s body [138] in homage. Divine music and song sounded from the sky in homage to the Tathāgata.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">5.3. And the Lord said: ‘Ananda, these <i class="calibre9">sāl</i>-trees have burst forth into an abundance of untimely blossoms ... Divine music and song sound from the sky in homage to the Tathāgata. Never before has the Tathāgata been so honoured, revered, esteemed, worshipped and adored. And yet, Ananda, whatever monk, nun, male or female lay-follower dwells practising the Dhamma properly, and perfectly fulfils the Dhamma-way, he or she honours the Tathāgata, reveres and esteems him and pays him the supreme homage. Therefore, Ananda, “We will dwell practising the Dhamma properly and perfectly fulfil the Dhamma-way” - this must be your watchword.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">5.4. Just then the Venerable Upavāna was standing in front of the Lord, fanning him. And the Lord told him to move: ‘Move aside, monk, do not stand in front of me.’ And the Venerable Ananda thought: ‘This Venerable [139] Upavāṇa has  for long been the Lord’s attendant, keeping close at hand, at his beck and call. And now in his last hour the Lord tells him to stand aside and not stand in front of him. Why ever does he do that?’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">5.5. And he asked the Lord about this. ‘Ānanda, the devas from ten world-spheres have gathered to see the Tathagata. For a distance of twelve yojanas around the Mallas’ <i class="calibre9">sāl</i>-grove near Kusinara there is not a space you could touch with the point of a hair that is not filled with mighty devas, and they are grumbling: “We have come a long way to see the Tathāgata. It is rare for a Tathagata, a fully-enlightened Buddha, to arise in the world, and tonight in the last watch the Tathāgata will attain final Nibbana, and this mighty monk is standing in front of the Lord, preventing us from getting a last glimpse of the Tathāgata!”’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">5.6. ‘But, Lord, what kind of devas can the Lord perceive?’ ‘Ananda, there are sky-devas whose minds are earth-bound, they are weeping and tearing their hair, raising their arms, [140] throwing themselves down and twisting and turning, crying: “All too soon the Blessed Lord is passing away, all too soon the Well-Farer is passing away, all too soon the Eye of the World is disappearing!” And there are earth-devas whose minds are earth-bound, who do likewise. But those devas who are free from craving endure patiently, saying: “All compounded things are impermanent &mdash; what is the use of this?”<a id="calibre_link-771" href="#calibre_link-2262" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">424</sup></a></div>
<div class="fmtx1">5.7. ‘Lord, formerly monks who had spent the Rains in various places used to come to see the Tathagata, and we used to welcome them so that such well-trained monks might see you and pay their respects. But with the Lord’s passing, we shall no longer have a chance to do this.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">5.8. ‘Ananda, there are four places the sight of which should arouse emotion<a id="calibre_link-772" href="#calibre_link-2263" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">425</sup></a> in the faithful. Which are they? “Here the Tathāgata was born” is the first.<a id="calibre_link-773" href="#calibre_link-2264" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">426</sup></a> “Here the Tathagata attained supreme enlightenment” is the second.<a id="calibre_link-774" href="#calibre_link-2265" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">427</sup></a> “Here the Tathāgata set in motion the Wheel of Dhamma” is the third.<a id="calibre_link-775" href="#calibre_link-2266" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">428</sup></a>  “Here the Tathagata attained the Nibbāna-element without remainder” is the fourth.<a id="calibre_link-776" href="#calibre_link-2267" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">429</sup></a> [141] And, Ananda, the faithful monks and nuns, male and female lay-followers will visit  those places. And any who die while making the pilgrimage to these shrines with a devout heart will, at the breaking-up of the body after death, be reborn in a heavenly world.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">5.9. ‘Lord, how should we act towards women?’ ‘Do not see them, Ananda.’ ‘But if we see them, how should we behave, Lord?’ ‘Do not speak to them, Ānanda.’ ‘But if they speak to us, Lord, how should we behave?’ ‘Practise mindfulness, Ānanda.’<a id="calibre_link-777" href="#calibre_link-2268" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">430</sup></a></div>
<div class="fmtx1">5.10. ‘Lord, what shall we do with the Tathāgata’s remains?’ ‘Do not worry yourselves about the funeral arrangements, Ananda. You should strive for the highest goal,<a id="calibre_link-778" href="#calibre_link-2269" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">431</sup></a> devote yourselves to the highest goal, and dwell with your minds tirelessly, zealously devoted to the highest goal. There are wise Khattiyas, Brahmins and householders who are devoted to the Tathāgata: they will take care of the funeral.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">5.11. ‘But, Lord, what are we to do with the Tathāgata’s remains?’ ‘Ananda, they should be dealt with like the remains of a wheel-turning monarch.’ ‘And how is that, Lord?’ ‘Ānanda, the remains of a wheel-turning monarch are wrapped in a new linen-cloth. This they wrap in teased cotton wool, and this in a [142] new cloth. Having done this five hundred times each, they enclose the king’s body in an oil-vat of iron,<a id="calibre_link-779" href="#calibre_link-2270" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">432</sup></a>  which is covered with another iron pot. Then having made a funeral-pyre of all manner of perfumes they cremate the king’s body, and they raise a stupa at a crossroads. That, Ananda, is what they do with the remains of a wheel-turning monarch, and they should deal with the Tathāgata’s body in the same way. A stupa should be erected at the crossroads for the Tathāgata. And whoever lays wreaths or puts sweet perfumes and colours<a id="calibre_link-780" href="#calibre_link-2271" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">433</sup></a> there with a devout heart, will reap benefit and happiness for a long time.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">5.12. ‘Ananda, there are four persons worthy of a stupa. Who are they? A Tathāgata, Arahant, fully-enlightened Buddha is one, a Pacceka Buddha<a id="calibre_link-781" href="#calibre_link-2272" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">434</sup></a> is one, a disciple of the Tathagata is one, and a wheel-turning monarch is one. And why is each of these worthy of a stupa? Because, Ananda, at the thought: “This is the stupa of a Tathāgata, of a Pacceka Buddha, [143] of a disciple of the Tathāgata, of a wheel-turning monarch”, people’s hearts are made peaceful, and then, at the  breaking-up of the body after death they go to a good destiny and rearise in a heavenly world. That is the reason, and those are the four who are worthy of a stupa.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">5.13. And the Venerable Ananda went into his lodging<a id="calibre_link-782" href="#calibre_link-2273" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">435</sup></a>  and stood lamenting, leaning on the door-post:<a id="calibre_link-783" href="#calibre_link-2274" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">436</sup></a> ‘Alas, I am still a learner with much to do! And the Teacher is passing away, who was so compassionate to me!’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Then the Lord enquired of the monks where Ananda was, and they told him. So he said to a certain monk: ‘Go, monk, and say to Ananda from me: “Friend Ananda, the Teacher summons you.”’ [144] ‘Very good, Lord’, said the monk, and did so. ‘Very good, friend’, Ananda replied to that monk, and he went to the Lord, saluted him and sat down to one side.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">5.14. And the Lord said: ‘Enough, Ananda, do not weep and wail! Have I not already told you that all things that are pleasant and delightful are changeable, subject to separation and becoming other? So how could it be, Ānanda - since whatever is born, become, compounded is subject to decay &mdash; how could it be that it should not pass away? For a long time, Ananda, you have been in the Tathagata’s presence, showing loving-kindness in act of body, speech and mind, beneficially, blessedly, whole-heartedly and unstintingly. You have achieved much merit, Ananda. Make the effort, and in a short time you will be free of the corruptions.’<a id="calibre_link-784" href="#calibre_link-2275" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">437</sup></a></div>
<div class="fmtx1">5.15. Then the Lord addressed the monks: ‘Monks, all those who were Arahant fully-enlightened Buddhas in the past have had just such a chief attendant as Ananda, and so too will those Blessed Lords who come in the future. Monks, Ananda is wise. He knows when it is the right time for monks to come to see the Tathagata, when it is the right time for nuns, for male lay-followers, [145] for female lay-followers, for kings, for royal ministers, for leaders of other schools, and for their pupils.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">5.16. ‘Ānanda has four remarkable and wonderful qualities. What are they? If a company of monks comes to see Ananda, they are pleased at the sight of him, and when Ananda talks Dhamma to them they are pleased, and when he is silent they are disappointed. And so it is, too, with nuns, with male and female lay-followers.<a id="calibre_link-785" href="#calibre_link-2276" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">438</sup></a> And these four qualities apply to a  wheel-turning monarch: if he is visited by a company of Khattiyas, of Brahmins, of householders, or of ascetics, they are pleased at the sight of him and when he talks to them, and when he is silent they are disappointed. [146] And so too it is with Ananda.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">5.17. After this the Venerable Ananda said: ‘Lord, may the Blessed Lord not pass away in this miserable little town of wattle-and-daub, right in the jungle in the back of beyond! Lord, there are other great cities such as Campa, Rajagaha, Savatthi, Saketa, Kosambi or Varanasi. In those places there are wealthy Khattiyas, Brahmins and householders who are devoted to the Tathagata, and they will provide for the Tathagata’s funeral in proper style.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Ananda, don’t call it a miserable little town of wattle-and-daub, right in the jungle in the back of beyond!</div>
<div class="fmtx1">5.18. ‘Once upon a time, Ananda, King Mahasudassana was a wheel-turning monarch, a rightful and righteous king, who had conquered the land in four directions and ensured the security of his realm, and who possessed the seven treasures. And, Ananda, this King Mahasudassana had this very Kusinara, under the name of Kusāvatī, for his capital. And it was twelve yojanas long from east to west, and seven yojanas wide from north to south. Kusāvatī was rich, prosperous [147] and well-populated, crowded with people and well-stocked with food. Just as the deva-city of Ālakamandā<a id="calibre_link-786" href="#calibre_link-2277" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">439</sup></a> is rich, prosperous and well-populated, crowded with yakkhas and well-stocked with food, so was the royal city of Kusāvatī. And the city of Kusāvatī was never free of ten sounds by day or night: the sound of elephants, horses, carriages, kettle-drums, side-drums, lutes, singing, cymbals and gongs, with cries of “Eat, drink and be merry!” as tenth.<a id="calibre_link-787" href="#calibre_link-2278" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">440</sup></a></div>
<div class="fmtx1">5.19. ‘And now, Ananda, go to Kusinara and announce to the Mallas of Kusinara: “Tonight, Vasetthas,<a id="calibre_link-788" href="#calibre_link-2279" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">441</sup></a> in the last watch, the Tathagata will attain final Nibbana. Approach him, Vasetthas, approach him, lest later you should regret it, saying: ‘The Tathagata passed away in our parish, and we did not take the opportunity to see him for the last time!’”’ ‘Very good, Lord’, said Ananda and, taking robe and bowl, he went with a companion to Kusinara.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">5.20. Just then the Mallas of Kusinārā were assembled in their meeting-hall on some business. And Ananda came to them and delivered the Lord’s words. [148]</div>
<div class="fmtx1">5.21. And when they heard Ānanda’s words, the Mallas, with their sons, daughters-in-law and wives were struck with anguish and sorrow, their minds were overcome with grief so that they were all weeping and tearing their hair...Then they all went to the <i class="calibre9">sāl</i>-grove where the Venerable Ananda was.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">5.22. And Ananda thought: ‘If I allow the Mallas of Kusinārā to salute the Lord individually, the night will have passed before they have all paid homage. I had better let them pay homage family by family, saying: “Lord, the Malla so-and-so with his children, his wife, his servants and his friends pays homage at the Lord’s feet.”’ And so he presented them in that way, and thus allowed all the Mallas of Kusinārā to pay homage to the Lord in the first watch.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">5.23. And at that time a wanderer called Subhadda was in Kusinārā, and he heard that the ascetic Gotama was to attain final Nibbāna in the final watch of that night. [149] He thought: ‘I have heard from venerable wanderers, advanced in years, teachers of teachers, that a Tathāgata, a fully-enlightened Buddha, only rarely arises in the world. And tonight in the last watch the ascetic Gotama will attain final Nibbāna. Now a doubt has arisen in my mind, and I feel sure that the ascetic Gotama can teach me a doctrine to dispel that doubt.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">5.24. So Subhadda went to the Mallas’ <i class="calibre9">sāl</i>-grove, to where the Venerable Ananda was, and told him what he had thought: ‘Reverend Ananda, may I be permitted to see the ascetic Gotama? ’ But Ananda replied: ‘Enough, friend Subhadda, do not disturb the Tathāgata, the Lord is weary.’ And Subhadda made his request a second and a third time, but still Ananda [150] refused it.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">5.25. But the Lord overheard this conversation between Ānanda and Subhadda, and he called to Ananda: ‘Enough, Ananda, do not hinder Subhadda, let him see the Tathāgata. For whatever Subhadda asks me he will ask in quest of enlightenment<a id="calibre_link-789" href="#calibre_link-2280" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">442</sup></a>  and not to annoy me, and what I say in reply to his questions he will quickly understand.’ Then Ananda said: ‘Go in, friend Subhadda, the Lord gives you leave.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">5.26. Then Subhadda approached the Lord, exchanged courtesies with him, and sat down to one side, saying: ‘Venerable Gotama, all those ascetics and Brahmins who have orders and followings, who are teachers, well-known and famous as founders of schools, and popularly regarded as saints, like Pūraṇa Kassapa, Makkhali Gosāla, Ajita Kesakambali, Pakudha Kaccāyana, Sañjaya Belatthaputta and the Nigantha Nātaputta - have they all realised the truth as they all make out, or have none [151] of them realised it, or have some realised it and some not?’ ‘Enough, Subhadda, never mind whether all, or none, or some of them have realised the truth. I will teach you Dhamma, Subhadda. Listen, pay close attention, and I will speak.’ ‘Yes, Lord’, said Subhadda, and the Lord said:</div>
<div class="fmtx1">5.27. ‘In whatever Dhamma and discipline the Noble Eightfold Path is not found, no ascetic is found of the first, the second, the third or the fourth grade.<a id="calibre_link-790" href="#calibre_link-2281" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">443</sup></a> But such ascetics can be found, of the first, second, third and fourth grade in a Dhamma and discipline where the Noble Eightfold Path is found. Now, Subhadda, in this Dhamma and discipline the Noble Eightfold Path is found, and in it are to be found ascetics of the first, second, third and fourth grade. Those other schools are devoid of [true] ascetics; but if in this one the monks were to live the life to perfection, the world would not lack for Arahants.</div>
<div class="atx"><div class="fmtx2">Twenty-nine years of age I was <br class="calibre6" />When I went forth to seek the Good. <br class="calibre6" />Now over fifty years have passed <br class="calibre6" />Since the day that I went forth <br class="calibre6" />To roam the realm of wisdom’s law <br class="calibre6" />Outside of which no ascetic is [152] <br class="calibre6" />[First, second, third or fourth degree]. <br class="calibre6" />Other schools of such are bare, <br class="calibre6" />But if here monks live perfectly, <br class="calibre6" />The world won’t lack for Arahants.<a id="calibre_link-791" href="#calibre_link-2282" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">444</sup></a></div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx1">5.28. At this the wanderer Subhadda said: ‘Excellent, Lord, excellent! It is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down, or to point out the way to one who had got lost, or to bring an oil lamp into a dark place, so that those  with eyes could see what was there. Just so the Blessed Lord has expounded the Dhamma in various ways. And I, Lord, go for refuge to the Blessed Lord, the Dhamma and the Sangha. May I receive the going-forth in the Lord’s presence! May I receive ordination!’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">5.29. ‘Subhadda, whoever, coming from another school, seeks the going-forth and ordination in this Dhamma and discipline, must wait four months on probation. And at the end of four months, those monks who are established in mind<a id="calibre_link-792" href="#calibre_link-2283" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">445</sup></a> may let him go forth and give him ordination to the status of a monk. However, there can be a distinction of persons.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Lord, if those coming from other schools must wait four months on probation,... I will wait four years, and then let them give me the going-forth and the ordination!’ But the Lord said to Ananda: ‘Let Subhadda go forth!’ ‘Very good, Lord’, said Ananda.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">5.30. And Subhadda said to the Venerable Ānanda: ‘Friend Ānanda, it is a great gain for you all, it is very profitable for you, that you have obtained the consecration of discipleship in the Teacher’s presence.’ [153]</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Then Subhadda received the going-forth in the Lord’s presence, and the ordination. And from the moment of his ordination the Venerable Subhadda, alone, secluded, unwearying, zealous and resolute, in a short time attained to that for which young men of good family go forth from the household life into homelessness, that unexcelled culmination of the holy life, having realised it here and now by his own insight, and dwelt therein: ‘Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further here.’ And the Venerable Subhadda became another of the Arahants. He was the last personal disciple of the Lord.<a id="calibre_link-793" href="#calibre_link-2284" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">446</sup></a></div>

The Lord repeated his words a second and a third time, and still the monks were silent. Then the Lord said: ‘Perhaps, monks, you do not ask out of respect for the Teacher. Then, monks, let one friend tell it to another.’ But still they were silent.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">6.6. And the Venerable Ananda said: ‘It is wonderful, Lord, it is marvellous! I clearly perceive that in this assembly there is not one monk who has doubts or uncertainty...’ ‘You, Ananda, speak from faith.<a id="calibre_link-799" href="#calibre_link-2290" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">452</sup></a> But the Tathāgata knows that in this assembly there is not one monk who has doubts or uncertainty about the Buddha, the Dhamma or the Sangha or about the path or the practice. Ānanda, the least one of these five hundred monks is a Stream-Winner, incapable of falling into states of woe, certain of Nibbāna.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">6.7. Then the Lord said to the monks: [156] ‘Now, monks, I declare to you: all conditioned things are of a nature to decay &mdash; strive on untiringly.’<a id="calibre_link-800" href="#calibre_link-2291" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">453</sup></a> These were the Tathāgata’s last words.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">6.8. Then the Lord entered the first jhāna. And leaving that  he entered the second, the third, the fourth jhāna. Then leaving the fourth jhāna he entered the Sphere of Infinite Space, then the Sphere of Infinite Consciousness, then the Sphere of No-Thingness, then the Sphere of Neither-Perception-Nor-Non-Perception, and leaving that he attained the Cessation of Feeling and Perception.<a id="calibre_link-801" href="#calibre_link-2292" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">454</sup></a></div>
<div class="fmtx1">Then the Venerable Ananda said to the Venerable Anuruddha: ‘Venerable Anuruddha, the Lord has passed away.’ ‘No, friend Ānanda,<a id="calibre_link-802" href="#calibre_link-2293" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">455</sup></a> the Lord has not passed away, he has attained the Cessation of Feeling and Perception.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">6.9. Then the Lord, leaving the attainment of the Cessation of Feeling and Perception, entered the Sphere of Neither-Perception-Nor-Non-Perception, from that he entered the Sphere of No-Thingness, the Sphere of Infinite Consciousness, the Sphere of Infinite Space. From the Sphere of Infinite Space he entered the fourth jhāna, from there the third, the second and the first jhāna. Leaving the first jhāna, he entered the second, the third, the fourth jhāna. And, leaving the fourth jhāna, the Lord finally passed away.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">6.10. And at the Blessed Lord’s final passing there was a great earthquake, terrible and hair-raising, accompanied by thunder. [157] And Brahmā Sahampati<a id="calibre_link-803" href="#calibre_link-2294" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">456</sup></a> uttered this verse:<div class="afmtx"><div class="fmtx2">‘All beings in the world, all bodies must break up: <br class="calibre6" />Even the Teacher, peerless in the human world, <br class="calibre6" />The mighty Lord and perfect Buddha’s passed away.’</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx">And Sakka, ruler of the devas, uttered this verse:<div class="afmtx"><div class="fmtx2">‘Impermanent are compounded things, prone to rise and fall,</div>
<div class="fmtx2">Having risen, they’re destroyed, their passing truest bliss.’<a id="calibre_link-804" href="#calibre_link-2295" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">457</sup></a></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx">And the Venerable Anuruddha uttered this verse:<div class="afmtx"><div class="fmtx2">‘No breathing in and out - just with steadfast heart</div>
<div class="fmtx2">The Sage who’s free from lust has passed away to peace.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">With mind unshaken he endured all pains:</div>
<div class="fmtx2">By Nibbāna the Illumined’s mind is freed.’</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx">And the Venerable Ananda uttered this verse:<div class="afmtx"><div class="fmtx2">‘Terrible was the quaking, men’s hair stood on end, <br class="calibre6" />When the all-accomplished Buddha passed away.’</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx">And those monks who had not yet overcome their passions wept and tore their hair, raising their arms, throwing themselves down and twisting and turning, crying: ‘All too soon [158] the Blessed Lord has passed away, all too soon the Well-Farer has passed away, all too soon the Eye of the World has disappeared!’ But those monks who were free from craving endured mindfully and clearly aware, saying: ‘All compounded things are impermanent &mdash; what is the use of this?’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">6.11. Then the Venerable Anuruddha said: ‘Friends, enough of your weeping and wailing! Has not the Lord already told you that all things that are pleasant and delightful are changeable, subject to separation and to becoming other? So why all this, friends? Whatever is born, become, compounded is subject to decay, it cannot be that it does not decay. The devas, friends, are grumbling.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Venerable Anuruddha, what kind of devas are you aware of?’ ‘Friend Ānanda, there are sky-devas whose minds are earth-bound they are weeping and tearing their hair...And there are earth-devas whose minds are earth-bound, they do likewise. But those devas who are free from craving endure patiently, saying: “All compounded things are impermanent. What is the use of this?”’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">6.12. Then the Venerable Anuruddha and the Venerable Ānanda spent the rest of the night in conversation on Dhamma. And the Venerable Anuruddha said: ‘Now go, friend Ananda, to Kusinara and announce to the Mallas: “Vasetthas, the Lord has passed away. Now is the time to do as you think fit.” “Yes, Lord”, said Ananda, and having dressed in the morning and taken his robe and bowl, he went with a companion to Kusinara. [159] At that time the Mallas of Kusinara were assembled in their meeting-hall on some business. And the Venerable Ānanda came to them and delivered the Venerable Anuruddha’s message. And when they heard the Venerable Ānanda’s words, the Mallas ... were struck with anguish and sorrow, their minds were overcome with grief so that they were all tearing their hair...</div>
<div class="fmtx1">6.13. Then the Mallas ordered their men to bring perfume and wreaths, and gather all the musicians together. And with the perfumes and wreaths, and all the musicians, and with five hundred sets of garments they went to the <i class="calibre9">sāl</i>-grove where the Lord’s body was lying. And there they honoured, paid respects, worshipped and adored the Lord’s body with dance and song and music, with garlands and scents, making awnings and circular tents in order to spend the day there. And they thought: ‘It is too late to cremate the Lord’s body today. We shall do so tomorrow.’ And so, paying homage in the same way, they waited for a second, a third, a fourth, a fifth, a sixth day.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">6.14. And on the seventh day the Mallas of Kusinara thought: [160] ‘We have paid sufficient honour with song and dance... to the Lord’s body, now we shall burn his body after carrying him out by the south gate.’ Then eight Malla chiefs, having washed their heads and put on new clothes, declared: ‘Now we will lift up the Lord’s body’, but found they were unable to do so. So they went to the Venerable Anuruddha and told him what had happened: ‘Why can’t we lift up the Lord’s body?’ ‘Vasetthas, your intention is one thing, but the intention of the devas is another.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">6.15. ‘Lord, what is the intention of the devas?’ ‘Vasetthas, your intention is, having paid homage to the Lord’s body with dance and song..., to burn his body after carrying him out by the south gate. But the devas’ intention is, having paid homage to the Lord’s body with heavenly dance and song..., to carry him to the north of the city, bring him in through the north gate and bear him through the middle of the city and out through the eastern gate to the Mallas’ shrine of Makuta-Bandhana, and there to burn the body.’ ‘Lord, if that is the devas’ intention, so be it!’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">6.16. At that time even the sewers and rubbish-heaps of Kusinara were covered knee-high with coral-tree flowers. And the devas as well as the Mallas of Kusinara honoured the Lord’s body with divine and human [161] dancing, song...; and they carried the body to the north of the city, brought it in through the north gate, through the middle of the city and out through the eastern gate to the Mallas’ shrine of Makuta-here they set the body down.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">6.17. Then they asked the Venerable Ananda: ‘Lord, how should we deal with the body of the Tathāgata?’ ‘Vāseṭṭhas, you should deal with the Tathāgata’s body as you would that of a wheel-turning monarch.’ ‘And how do they deal with that, Lord?’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Vaseṭṭhas, the remains are wrapped in a new linen-cloth. This they wrap in teased cotton-wool...; then having made a funeral-pyre of all manner of perfumes, they cremate the king’s body and they raise a stupa at a cross roads...’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">6.18. Then the Mallas ordered their men to bring their teased cotton-wool. And they dealt with the Tathāgata’s body accordingly... [162]</div>
<div class="fmtx1">6.19. Now just then the Venerable Kassapa the Great<a id="calibre_link-805" href="#calibre_link-2296" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">458</sup></a> was travelling along the main road from Pāvā to Kusinārā with a large company of about five hundred monks. And leaving the road, the Venerable Kassapa the Great sat down under a tree. And a certain Ājīvika<a id="calibre_link-806" href="#calibre_link-2297" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">459</sup></a> chanced to be coming along the main road towards Pāvā, and he had picked a coral-tree flower in Kusinārā. The Venerable Kassapa saw him coming from afar, and said to him: ‘Friend, do you know our Teacher?’ ‘Yes, friend, I do. The ascetic Gotama passed away a week ago. I picked this coral-tree flower there.’ And those monks who had not yet overcome their passions wept and tore their hair... But those monks who were free from craving endured mindfully and clearly aware, saying: ‘All compounded things are impermanent - what is the use of this?’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">6.20. And sitting in the group was one Subhadda,<a id="calibre_link-807" href="#calibre_link-2298" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">460</sup></a> who had gone forth late in life, and he said to those monks: ‘Enough, friends, do not weep and wail! We are well rid of the Great Ascetic. We were always bothered by his saying: “It is fitting for you to do this, it is not fitting for you to do that!” Now we can do what we like, and not do what we don’t like!’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">But the Venerable Kassapa the Great said to the monks: ‘Friends, enough of your weeping and wailing! [163] Has not the Lord already told you that all things that are pleasant and delightful are changeable, subject to separation and becoming other? So why all this, friends? Whatever is born, become, compounded is subject to decay, it cannot be that it does not decay.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">6.21. Meanwhile four Malla chiefs, having washed their heads and put on new clothes, said: ‘We will light the Lord’s funeral pyre’, but they were unable to do so. They went to the Venerable Anuruddha and asked him why this was. ‘Vāseṭṭhas, your intention is one thing, but that of the devas is another.’ ‘Well, Lord, what is the intention of the devas?’ ‘Vāseṭṭhas, the devas’ intention is this: “The Venerable Kassapa the Great is coming along the main road from Pāvā to Kusinārā with a large company of five hundred monks. The Lord’s funeral pyre will not be lit until the Venerable Kassapa the Great has paid homage with his head to the Lord’s feet.’ ‘Lord, if that is the devas’ intention, so be it!’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">6.22. Then the Venerable Kassapa the Great went to the Mallas’ shrine at Makuta-Bandhana to the Lord’s funeral pyre and, covering one shoulder with his robe, joined his hands in salutation, circumambulated the pyre three times and, uncovering the Lord’s feet, paid homage with his head to them, and the five hundred monks did likewise. [164] And when this was done, the Lord’s funeral pyre ignited of itself.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">6.23. And when the Lord’s body was burnt, what had been skin, under-skin, flesh, sinew, or joint-fluid, all that vanished and not even ashes or dust remained, only the bones<a id="calibre_link-808" href="#calibre_link-2299" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">461</sup></a> remained. Just as when butter or oil is burnt, no ashes or dust remain, so it was with the Lord’s body..., only the bones were left. And all the five hundred garments, even the innermost and the outermost cloth, were burnt up. And when the Lord’s body was burnt up, a shower of water from the sky, and another which burst forth from the <i class="calibre9">sāl</i>-trees<a id="calibre_link-809" href="#calibre_link-2300" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">462</sup></a> extinguished the funeral pyre. And the Mallas of Kusinārā poured perfumed water over it for the same purpose. Then the Mallas honoured the relics for a week in their assembly hall, having made a lattice-work of spears and an encircling wall of bows, with dancing, singing, garlands and music.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">6.24. And King Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha heard that the Lord had passed away at Kusinārā.And he sent a message to the Mallas of Kusinārā: ‘The Lord was a Khattiya and I am a Khattiya. I am worthy to receive a share of the Lord’s remains. I will make a great stupa for them.’ The Licchavis of Vesālī heard, and they sent a message: ‘The Lord  was a Khattiya and we are Khattiyas. We are worthy to [165] receive a share of the Lord’s remains, and we will make a great stupa for them.’ The Sakyas of Kapilavatthu heard, and they sent a message: ‘The Lord was the chief of our clan. We are worthy to receive a share of the Lord’s remains, and we will make a great stupa for them.’ ‘The Bulayas of Allakappa and the Koliyas of Rāmagāma replied similarly. The Brahmin of Vethadipa heard, and he sent a message: ‘The Lord was a Khattiya, I am a Brahmin...’, and the Mallas of Pava sent a message: ‘The Lord was a Khattiya, we are Khattiyas. We are worthy to receive a share of the Lord’s remains, and we will make a great stupa for them.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">6.25. On hearing all this, the Mallas of Kusinārā addressed the crowd, saying: [166] ‘The Lord passed away in our parish. We will not give away any share of the Lord’s remains.’ At this the Brahmin Dona addressed the crowd in this verse:<div class="afmtx"><div class="fmtx2">‘Listen, lords, to my proposal. <br class="calibre6" />Forbearance is the Buddha’s teaching. <br class="calibre6" />It is not right that strife should come <br class="calibre6" />From sharing out the best of men’s remains. <br class="calibre6" />Let’s all be joined in harmony and peace, <br class="calibre6" />In friendship sharing out portions eight: <br class="calibre6" />Let stupas far and wide be put up, <br class="calibre6" />That all may see &mdash; and gain in faith!’</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx">‘Well then, Brahmin, you divide up the remains of the Lord in the best and fairest way!’ ‘Very good, friends’, said Dona. And he made a good and fair division into eight portions, and then said to the assembly: ‘Gentlemen, please give me the urn, and I will erect a great stupa for it.’ So they gave Dona the urn.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">6.26. Now the Moriyas of Pipphalavana heard of the Lord’s passing, and they sent a message: ‘The Lord was a Khattiya and we are Khattiyas. We are worthy to receive a portion of the Lord’s remains, and we will make a great stupa for them.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘There is not a portion of the Lord’s remains left, they have all been divided up. So you must take the embers.’ And so they took the embers.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">6.27. Then King Ajatasattu of Magadha built a great stupa  for the Lord’s relics at Rajagaha. [167] The Licchavis of Vesālī built one at Vesālī, the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu built one at Kapilavatthu, the Bulayas of Allakappa built one at Allakappa, the Koliyas of Ramagama built one at Ramagama, the Brahmin of Vethadipa built one at Vethadipa, the Mallas of Pava built one at Pava, the Mallas of Kusinara built a great stupa for the Lord’s relics at Kusinara, the Brahmin Dona built a great stupa for the urn, and the Moriyas of Pipphalavana built a great stupa for the embers at Pipphalavana. Thus, eight stupas were built for the relics, a ninth for the urn, and a tenth for the embers. That is how it was in the old days.<a id="calibre_link-810" href="#calibre_link-2301" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">463</sup></a></div>
<div class="atx"><div class="fmtx2">6.28. Eight portions of relics there were of him, <br class="calibre6" />The All-Seeing One. Of these, seven remained <br class="calibre6" />In Jambudīpa with honour.

<div class="fmtx1">1.2. The Venerable Ananda came to the Lord, saluted him, sat down to one side and said: ‘Lord, may the Blessed Lord not pass away in this miserable little town of wattle-and-daub, right in the jungle in the back of beyond! Lord, there are other great cities such as Campa, Rajagaha, Savatthi, Saketa, Kosambi or Vārānāsī. In those places there are wealthy Khattiyas, Brahmins and householders who are devoted to the Tathagata and they will provide for the Tathāgata’s funeral in proper style.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.3. ‘Ananda, don’t call it a miserable little town of wattle-and-daub, right in the jungle in the back of beyond! Once upon a time, Ananda, King Mahāsudassana<a id="calibre_link-813" href="#calibre_link-2365" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">466</sup></a> was a wheel-turning monarch, a rightful and righteous king, who had conquered the land in four directions and ensured the security of his realm. [170] And this King Mahasudassana had this very Kusinara, under the name of Kusāvatī, for his capital. And it was twelve yojanas long from east to west, and seven yojanas wide from north to south. Kusāvatī was rich, prosperous and well-populated, crowded with people and well-stocked with food. Just as the deva-city of Āḷakamandā is rich... (<i class="calibre9">as Sutta 16</i>,  <i class="calibre9">verse</i> 5.18), so was the royal city of Kusavati. And the city of Kusavati was never free of ten sounds by day or night: the sound of elephants, horses, carriages, kettle-drums, side-drums, lutes, singing, cymbals and gongs, with cries of “Eat, drink and be merry” as tenth.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.4. ‘The royal city of Kusāvatī was surrounded by seven  encircling walls. One was of gold, one silver, one beryl, one crystal, one ruby, one emerald, and one of all sorts of gems.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.5. ‘And the gates of Kusavati were of four colours: one gold, one silver, one beryl, one crystal. [171] And before each gate were set seven pillars, three or four times a man’s height. One was of gold, one silver, one beryl, one crystal, one ruby, one emerald, and one of all sorts of gems.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.6. ‘Kusāvatī was surrounded by seven rows of palm-trees, of the same materials. The gold trees had gold trunks with silver leaves and fruit, the silver trees had silver trunks with gold leaves and fruit. The beryl trees had beryl trunks with crystal leaves and fruit, the crystal trees had crystal trunks with beryl leaves and fruit. The ruby trees had ruby trunks and emerald leaves and fruit, the emerald trees had emerald trunks and ruby leaves and fruit, while the trees of all sorts of gems were the same as regards trunks, leaves and fruit. The sound of the leaves stirred by the wind was lovely, delightful, sweet and intoxicating, just like that of the five kinds of musical instruments<a id="calibre_link-814" href="#calibre_link-2366" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">467</sup></a> played in concert by well-trained and skilful players. [172] And, Ananda, those who were libertines and drunkards in Kusavati had their desires assuaged by the sound of the leaves in the wind.<a id="calibre_link-815" href="#calibre_link-2367" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">468</sup></a></div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.7. ‘King Mahasudassana was endowed with the seven treasures and the four properties. What are the seven? Once, on a fast-day of the fifteenth,<a id="calibre_link-816" href="#calibre_link-2368" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">469</sup></a> when the King had washed his head and gone up to the verandah on top of his palace to observe the fast-day, the divine Wheel-Treasure<a id="calibre_link-817" href="#calibre_link-2369" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">470</sup></a> appeared to him, thousand-spoked, complete with felloe, hub and all appurtenances. On seeing it, King Mahasudassana thought: “I have heard that when a duly anointed Khattiya king sees such a wheel on the fast-day of the fifteenth, he will become a wheel-turning monarch. May I become such a monarch!”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.8. ‘Then, rising from his seat, covering one shoulder with his robe, the King took a gold vessel in his left hand, sprinkled the Wheel with his right hand, and said: “May the noble Wheel-Treasure turn, may the noble Wheel-Treasure conquer!” The Wheel turned to the east, and King Mahasudassana followed it with his fourfold army.<a id="calibre_link-818" href="#calibre_link-2370" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">471</sup></a> And in whatever country [173] the Wheel stopped, the King took up residence with his fourfold army.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.9. ‘And those kings who faced him in the eastern region came and said: “Come, Your Majesty, welcome! We are yours, Your Majesty.

Be moderate in eating.”<a id="calibre_link-819" href="#calibre_link-2371" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">472</sup></a> And those who had faced him in the eastern region became his subjects.</div>

Having plunged into the southern sea it turned west..., having plunged into the western sea it turned north, and King Mahasudassana followed it with his fourfold army</div>
<div class="fmtx1">... [174] and those who had faced him in the northern region became his subjects.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.11. ‘Then the Wheel-Treasure, having conquered the lands from sea to sea, returned to the royal capital of Kusāvati and stopped before the King’s palace as he was trying a case,<a id="calibre_link-820" href="#calibre_link-2372" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">473</sup></a> as if to adorn the royal palace.

And once the King, to try him, mounted the Elephant-Treasure at crack of dawn and rode him from sea to sea, returning to Kusāvatī in time for breakfast. And that is how the Elephant-Treasure appeared to King Mahasudassana.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.13. ‘Then the Horse-Treasure appeared to King Mahasudassana, with a crow’s head,<a id="calibre_link-823" href="#calibre_link-2375" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">476</sup></a> dark-maned, with the wondrous power of travelling through the air, a royal stallion called Valahaka.<a id="calibre_link-824" href="#calibre_link-2376" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">477</sup></a> And the King thought: “What a wonderful mount, if only he could be brought under control!” And [175] this Horse-Treasure submitted to control just like a thoroughbred that had been trained for a long time...

<div class="fmtx1">1.14. ‘Then the Jewel-Treasure appeared to King Mahāsudassana.  It was a beryl, pure, excellent, well-cut into eight facets, clear, bright, unflawed, perfect in every respect. The lustre of this Jewel-Treasure radiated for an entire yojana round about. And once the King, to try it, went on night-manoeuvres on a dark night with his four-fold army, with the Jewel-Treasure fixed to the top of his standard. And all who lived in the villages round about started their daily work, thinking it was daylight. And that is how the Jewel-Treasure appeared to King Mahāsudassana.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.15. ‘Then the Woman-Treasure appeared to King Mahāsudassana, lovely, fair to see, charming, with a lotus-like complexion, not too tall or too short, not too thin or too fat, not too dark or too fair, of more than human, deva-like beauty. And the touch of the skin of the Woman-Treasure was like cotton or silk, and her limbs were cool when it was hot, and warm when it was cold. Her body smelt of sandal-wood and her lips of lotus. This Woman-Treasure rose before the King [176] and retired later, and was always willing to do his pleasure, and she was pleasant of speech. And this Woman-Treasure was not unfaithful to the King even in thought, much less in deed. And that is how the Woman-Treasure appeared to King Mahasudassana.  <a id="calibre_link-825" href="#calibre_link-2377" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">478</sup></a></div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.16. ‘Then the Householder-Treasure appeared to King Mahasudassana. With the divine eye which, as the result of kamma, he possessed,<a id="calibre_link-826" href="#calibre_link-2378" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">479</sup></a> he saw where treasure, owned and ownerless, was hidden. He came to the King and said: “Have no fear, Your Majesty, I will look after your wealth properly.” And once, the King, to try him, went on board a ship and had it taken to the current in the middle of the Ganges. Then he said to the Householder-Treasure: “Householder, I want some gold coin!” “Well then, Sire, let the ship be brought to one bank.” “I want the gold coins here!” Then the householder touched the water with both hands and drew out a vessel full of gold coins, saying: “Is that enough, Sire? Will that do, Sire?” and the King said: “That is enough, householder, that will do, you have served me enough.” [177] And that is how the Householder-Treasurer appeared to King Mahāsudassana.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.17. ‘Then the Counsellor-Treasure appeared to King Mahāsudassana. He was wise, experienced, clever and competent to  advise the King on how to proceed with what should be proceeded with, and to withdraw from what should be withdrawn from, and to overlook what should be overlooked.<a id="calibre_link-827" href="#calibre_link-2379" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">480</sup></a> He came to the King and said: “Have no fear, Your Majesty, I shall advise you.” And that is how the Counsellor-Treasure appeared to King Mahasudassana, and how he was equipped with all the seven treasures.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.18. ‘Again, Ananda, King Mahasudassana was endowed with the four properties.<a id="calibre_link-828" href="#calibre_link-2380" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">481</sup></a> What are they? Firstly, the King was handsome, good to look at, pleasing, with a complexion like the finest lotus, surpassing other men.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.19. ‘Secondly, he was long-lived, outliving other men.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.20. ‘Thirdly, he was free from illness, free from sickness, with a healthy digestion, less subject to cold and heat than that of other men.<a id="calibre_link-829" href="#calibre_link-2381" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">482</sup></a> [178]</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.21. ‘Fourthly, he was beloved and popular with Brahmins and householders. Just as a father is beloved by his children, so he was with Brahmins and householders. And they were beloved by the King as children are beloved by their father. Once the King set out for the pleasure-park with his fourfold army, and the Brahmins and householders came to him and said: “Pass slowly by, Sire, that we may see you as long as possible!” And the King said to the charioteer: “Drive the chariot slowly so that I can see these Brahmins and householders as long as possible.” Thus King Mahasudassana was endowed with these four properties.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.22. ‘Then King Mahasudassana thought: “Suppose I were to construct lotus-ponds between the palm-trees, a hundred bow-lengths<a id="calibre_link-830" href="#calibre_link-2382" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">483</sup></a> apart.” And he did so. The lotus-ponds were lined with four-coloured tiles, gold, silver, beryl and crystal, each pond being approached by four staircases, one gold, one silver, one beryl and one crystal. And the gold staircase had gold posts [179] with silver railings and banisters, the silver had silver posts with gold railings and banisters, and so on. And the lotus-ponds were provided with two kinds of parapet, gold and silver &mdash; the gold parapets having gold posts, silver railings and banisters, and the silver parapets having silver posts, gold railings and banisters.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.23. ‘Then the King thought: “Suppose I were to provide  each pond with suitable [flowers for] garlands<a id="calibre_link-831" href="#calibre_link-2383" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">484</sup></a> - blue, yellow, red and white lotuses which will last through all seasons without fading?” And he did so. Then he thought: “Suppose I were to place bathmen on the banks of these ponds, to bathe those who come there?” And he did so. Then he thought: “Suppose I were to establish charitable posts on the banks of these ponds, so that those who want food can get it, those who want drink can get it, those who want clothes can get it, those who want transport can get it, those who want a sleeping-place can get it, those who want a wife can get one, and those who want gold coin can get it?” [180] And he did so.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.24. ‘Then the Brahmins and householders took great wealth and went to the King, saying: “Sire, here is wealth that we have gathered together especially for Your Majesty, please accept it!” “Thank you, friends, but I have enough wealth from legitimate revenues. Let this be yours, and take away more besides!” Being thus refused by the King, they withdrew to one side and considered: “It would not be right for us to take this wealth back home again. Suppose we were to build a dwelling for King Mahasudassana.” So they went to the King and said: “Sire, we would build you a dwelling”, and the King accepted by silence.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.25. ‘Then Sakka, ruler of the gods, knowing in his mind King Mahasudassana’s thought, said to the attendant-deva Vissakamma:  <a id="calibre_link-832" href="#calibre_link-2384" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">485</sup></a> “Come, friend Vissakamma, and build a dwelling for King Mahasudassana, a palace called Dhamma.” “Very good, Lord”, Vissakamma [181] replied and, as swiftly as a strong man might stretch his flexed arm or flex it again, he at once vanished from the Heaven of the Thirty-Three and appeared before King Mahasudassana, and said to him: “Sire, I shall build you a dwelling, a palace called Dhamma.” The King assented by silence, and Vissakamma built him the Palace of Dhamma.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.26. ‘The Palace of Dhamma, Ananda, was a yojana in length from east to west, and half a yojana wide from north to south. The whole palace was faced up to three times a man’s height with tiles of four colours, gold, silver, beryl and crystal, and it contained eighty-four thousand columns of the same four colours. It had twenty-four staircases of the same four colours,  and the gold staircases had gold posts with silver railings and banisters... (<i class="calibre9">as verse 23</i>)<i class="calibre9">.</i> [182] It also had eighty-four thousand chambers of the same colours. In the gold chamber was a silver couch, in the silver chamber a gold couch, in the beryl chamber an ivory couch, and in the crystal chamber a sandalwood couch. On the door of the gold chamber a silver palm-tree was figured, with silver stem, gold leaves and fruit... On the door of the silver chamber a golden palm-tree was figured, with golden trunk, leaves and fruit, on the door of the beryl chamber a crystal palm-tree was figured, with crystal trunk and beryl leaves and fruit, on the door of the crystal chamber a beryl palm-tree was figured, with crystal leaves and fruit.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.27. ‘Then the King thought: “Suppose I were to make a grove of palm-trees all of gold by the door of the great gabled chamber where I sit in the daytime?” and he did so.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.28. ‘Surrounding the Dhamma Palace were two parapets, [183] one of gold, one of silver. The gold one had gold posts, silver railings and banisters, and the silver one had silver posts, gold railings and banisters.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.29. ‘The Dhamma Palace was surrounded by two nets of tinkling bells. One net was gold with silver bells, the other silver with gold bells. And when these nets of bells were stirred by the wind their sound was lovely, delightful, sweet and intoxicating, just like that of the five kinds of musical instruments played in concert by well-trained and skilful players. And those who were libertines and drunkards in Kusāvatī had their desires assuaged by the sound of those nets of bells.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.30. ‘And when the Dhamma Palace was finished, it was hard to look at, dazzling to the eyes, just as in the last month of the Rains, in autumn, when there is a clear and cloudless sky, the sun breaking through the mists is hard to look at, [184] so was the Dhamma Palace when it was finished.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.31. ‘Then the King thought: “Suppose I were to make a lotus-lake called Dhamma in front of the Dhamma Palace?” so he did so. This lake was a yojana long from east to west, and half a yojana wide from north to south, and lined with four kinds of tiles, gold, silver, beryl and crystal. There were twenty-four staircases to it of four different kinds: gold, silver, beryl and crystal. The gold staircases had gold posts with silver  railings and banisters, the silver had gold railings and banisters ... (<i class="calibre9">and so on, as verse 22</i>)<i class="calibre9">.</i></div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.32. ‘The Dhamma Lake was surrounded by seven kinds of palm-trees. The sound of the leaves stirred by the wind was lovely, delightful, sweet and intoxicating, just like that of the five kinds of musical instruments played in concert by well-trained and skilful players. And, Ananda, those who were libertines and drunkards in Kusāvatī had their desires assuaged by the sound of the leaves in the wind. [185]</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.33. ‘When the Dhamma Palace and the Dhamma Lake were finished, King Mahāsudassana, having satisfied every wish of those who at the time were ascetics or Brahmins, or revered as such, ascended into the Dhamma Palace.’</div>

<div class="fmtx1">2.3. ‘Then the King went into the great gabled chamber, sat down cross-legged on the golden couch and, detached from all sense-desires, detached from unwholesome mental states, entered and remained in the first jhāna, which is with thinking and pondering, born of detachment, filled with delight and joy. And with the subsiding of thinking and pondering, by gaining inner tranquillity and oneness of mind, he entered and remained in the second jhana, which is without thinking and pondering, born of concentration, filled with delight and joy. And with the fading away of delight, remaining imperturbable, mindful and clearly aware, he experienced in himself  that joy of which the Noble Ones say: “Happy is he who dwells with equanimity and mindfulness”, he entered and remained in the third jhāna. And, having given up pleasure and pain, and with the disappearance of former gladness and sadness, he entered and remained in the fourth jhāna which is beyond pleasure and pain, and purified by equanimity and mindfulness.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.4. ‘Then the King, emerging from the great gabled chamber, went to the golden gabled chamber and, seated cross-legged on the silver couch, stayed pervading first one quarter, then the second, the third and the fourth quarter with a mind filled with loving-kindness.

<div class="fmtx1">2.7. ‘And, Ananda, after many hundred, many hundred thousand years, Queen Subhadda thought: “It is a long time since I saw King Mahasudassana.

And Queen Subhadda said to the Counsellor-Treasure : “Friend Counsellor, draw up the fourfold army. It is long since we saw King Mahasudassana.

<div class="fmtx1">2.9. ‘Then King Mahasudassana said to a certain man: “Here, fellow, go to the great gabled chamber, bring the gold couch out and lay it down among the gold palm-trees.” “Very good, Sire”, said the man, and did so.

<div class="fmtx1">‘This is how you should speak: “All things that are pleasing and attractive are liable to change, to vanish, to become otherwise. Do not, Sire, die filled with longing.

<div class="fmtx1">2.13. ‘Soon after this, King Mahasudassana died; and just as a householder or his son might feel drowsy after a good meal, so he felt the sensation [196] of passing away, and he had a favourable rebirth in the Brahmā-world.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘King Mahasudassana indulged in boyish sports for eighty-four thousand years, for eighty-four thousand years he exercised the viceroyalty, for eighty-four thousand years he ruled as King, and for eighty-four thousand years, as a layman, he lived the holy life in the Dhamma Palace.<a id="calibre_link-841" href="#calibre_link-2393" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">494</sup></a> And, having practised the four divine abidings, at the breaking-up of the body he was reborn in the Brahmā-world.<a id="calibre_link-842" href="#calibre_link-2394" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">495</sup></a></div>

<div class="fmtx1">2.16. ‘See, Ananda, how all those conditioned states of the past have vanished and changed! Thus, Ananda, conditioned states are impermanent, they are unstable, they can bring us no comfort, and such being the case, Ananda, we should not rejoice in conditioned states, we should cease to take an interest in them, and be liberated from them.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.17. ‘Six times, Ānanda, I recall discarding the body in this place, and at the seventh time I discarded it as a wheel-turning monarch, a righteous king who had conquered the four quarters and established a firm rule, and who possessed the seven treasures.

<div class="fmtx1">So the Lord spoke. The Well-Farer having said this, the Teacher said:<div class="afmtx"><div class="fmtx2">‘Impermanent are compounded things, prone to rise and fall,</div>

Once the Lord was staying at Nādikā at the Brick House.<a id="calibre_link-844" href="#calibre_link-124" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">497</sup></a> And at that time the Lord was explaining the rebirths of various devotees up and down the country who had died and passed away: Kāsis and Kosalans, Vajjians and Mallas, Cetis and Vamsas, Kurus and Pañcālas, Macchas and Sūrasenas, saying: ‘This one was reborn there, and that one there.’<a id="calibre_link-845" href="#calibre_link-125" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">498</sup></a> More than fifty Nādikan devotees, having abandoned the five lower fetters, were reborn spontaneously and would attain Nibbāna without returning to this world; over ninety of them, having abandoned three fetters and weakened greed, hatred and delusion, were Once-Returners, who would return to this world once more and then make an end of suffering; and more than five hundred, having abandoned three fetters, were Stream-Winners, incapable of falling into states of woe, certain of Nibbāna. [201]</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2. This news reached the ears of the devotees in Nādikā, and they were pleased, delighted and filled with joy to hear the Lord’s replies.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">3. And the Venerable Ananda heard of the Lord’s report<a id="calibre_link-846" href="#calibre_link-126" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">499</sup></a>  and the Nādikans’ delight.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">4. And he thought: [202] ‘There were also Magadhan disciples of long standing who have died and passed away. One would think Anga and Magadha contained no Magadhan disciples who had died. Yet they too were devoted to the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, and they observed the discipline perfectly. The Lord has not stated their destiny. It would be good to have a declaration about this: it would make the multitude have faith and so attain a good rebirth.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Now King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha was a righteous  and lawful king, a friend of Brahmins, householders, town and country-dwellers, so that his fame is spread abroad: “That righteous king of ours is dear<a id="calibre_link-847" href="#calibre_link-127" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">500</sup></a> who gave us so much happiness. Life was easy for us who dwelt under his righteous rule.”<a id="calibre_link-848" href="#calibre_link-128" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">501</sup></a> And he was devoted to the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, and observed the discipline perfectly. Thus people say: “King Bimbisāra, who praised the Lord to his dying day, is dead!” The Lord has not declared his destiny, and it would be good to have a declaration... Besides, it was in Magadha that the Lord gained his enlightenment. Since the Lord gained his enlightenment in Magadha, why does he not declare the destinies of those who have died there? For the Lord not to make such a declaration would cause unhappiness to the Magadhans. [203] Such being the case, why does not the Lord make such a declaration?’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">5. And after thus reflecting in solitude on behalf of the Magadhan devotees, the Venerable Ananda rose at the crack of dawn, went to the Lord and saluted him. Then, sitting down to one side, he said: ‘Lord, I have heard what has been declared concerning the inhabitants of Nādikā.’ (as verse <i class="calibre9">1</i>-<i class="calibre9">2</i>)</div>
<div class="fmtx1">6. ‘These were all devoted to the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, and they observed the discipline perfectly. The Lord has not stated their destiny...

<div class="fmtx1">7. As soon as Ananda had gone, the Lord took his robe and bowl and went into Nādikā for alms. Later, on his return, after his meal, he went to the Brick House and, having washed his feet, he went in and, having thought over, considered and given his whole mind to the question of the Magadhan devotees, he sat down on the prepared seat, saying: ‘I shall know their destiny and future lot, whatever it is.’<a id="calibre_link-849" href="#calibre_link-129" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">502</sup></a> And then he perceived the destiny and fate of [205] each one of them. And in the evening, emerging from meditative seclusion, the Lord came out of the Brick House and sat down on the prepared seat in the shade of his lodging.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">8. Then the Venerable Ananda came to the Lord, saluted  him, sat down to one side and said: ‘Lord, the Lord’s countenance looks bright and shining, showing that the Lord’s mind is at ease. Has the Lord been satisfied with today’s lodging?’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">9. ‘Ananda, after you spoke to me about the devotees of Magadha, I took my robe and bowl and went into Nādikā for alms. Later on ...

Then the voice of a yakkha <a id="calibre_link-850" href="#calibre_link-130" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">503</sup></a> who had passed over cried out: “I am Janavasabha, Lord!

<div class="fmtx1">10. ‘Ananda, immediately after I heard this voice, the yakkha appeared before me as a noble vision, and uttered a second cry: “I am Bimbisara, Lord! I am Bimbisāra, Well-Farer!

These are the four roads to power... And whatever ascetics or Brahmins have in the past realised such powers in different ways, they have all developed and strongly practised these four ways, and the same applies to all who may in the future, or who do now realise such powers. Do my lords the Thirty-Three observe such powers in me?’ ‘Yes, Brahmā.’ ‘Well, I too have developed and strongly practised [214] these four ways.’</div>

There are three gateways to the bliss proclaimed by the Lord who knows and sees. What are they? In the first place someone dwells in association with sense-desires, with unwholesome conditions. At some time he hears the Ariyan Dhamma, he pays close attention and practises in conformity with it. By so doing he comes to live dissociated from such sense-desires and unwholesome conditions. As a result of this dissociation, pleasant feeling<a id="calibre_link-874" href="#calibre_link-154" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">527</sup></a> arises, and what is more, gladness.<a id="calibre_link-875" href="#calibre_link-155" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">528</sup></a> Just as pleasure might give birth to rejoicing, so from pleasant feeling he experiences gladness.</div>

<div class="fmtx1">25. ‘“‘In the third place there is someone who really does not knew what is right and what is wrong, what is blameworthy  and what is not, what is to be practised and what is not, what is base and what is noble, and what is foul, fair or mixed in quality. At some time he hears the Ariyan Dhamma, he pays dose attention and practises in conformity with it. As a result, he comes to know in reality what is right and wrong, what is blameworthy and what is not, what is to be practised and what is not, what is base and what is noble, and what is foul, fair or mixed in quality. In him who knows and sees thus, ignorance is dispelled and knowledge arises. With the waning of ignorance and the arising of knowledge, pleasant feeling arises, and what is more, gladness. Just as pleasure might give birth to rejoicing, so from pleasant feeling he experiences gladness. [216] These are the three gateways to the bliss proclaimed by the Lord who knows and sees.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">26. ‘“This was the burden of Brahmā Sanankumāra’s speech. He went on: ‘What do my lords of the Thirty-Three think?

What are they? Here a monk abides contemplating the body as body, earnestly, clearly aware, mindful and having put away all hankering and fretting for the world. As he thus dwells contemplating his own body as body, he becomes perfectly concentrated and perfectly serene.

For indeed, my lords, the Dhamma is well-proclaimed by the Lord, visible here and now, timeless, inviting inspection, leading onward, to be comprehended by the wise, each one for him or herself, and, too, the doors to the Deathless are open!</div>

<div class="fmtx1">29. “‘Once upon a time there was a king called Disampati. His chaplain<a id="calibre_link-893" href="#calibre_link-1391" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">546</sup></a> was a Brahmin called the Steward.<a id="calibre_link-894" href="#calibre_link-1392" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">547</sup></a> The King’s son was a youth called Renu, and the Steward’s son was called Jotipāla. Prince Renu and Jotipāla, together with six other Khattiyas, formed a band of eight friends. [231] In the course of time the Steward died, and King Disampati mourned him, saying: ‘Alas, at the very moment when we had entrusted all our responsibilities to the Steward, and were abandoning ourselves to the pleasures of the five senses, the Steward has passed away!’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">“‘Hearing this, Prince Renu said: ‘Sire, do not mourn the Steward’s death overmuch! His son Jotipāla<a id="calibre_link-895" href="#calibre_link-1393" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">548</sup></a> is cleverer than his father was and has a better eye for what is advantageous. You should let Jotipāla manage all the business you entrusted to his father.’ ‘Is that so, my boy?’ ‘Yes, Sire.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">30. “‘Then the King called a man and said: ‘Come here, my good man, go to the youth Jotipāla and say: ”May the Reverend Jotipāla be well! King Disampati sends for you, he would like to see you.”’ ‘Very good, Your Majesty’, said the man, and delivered the message. [232] On receiving the message, Jotipāla said: ‘Very good, sir’, and went to see the King. On entering the royal presence, he exchanged courtesies with the King, then sat down to one side. The King said: ‘We wish the Reverend Jotipāla to manage our affairs. Do not refuse. I will  install you in your father’s place and consecrate<a id="calibre_link-896" href="#calibre_link-1394" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">549</sup></a> you as Steward.’ ‘Very good, Lord’, replied Jotipāla.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">31. “‘So King Disampati appointed Jotipāla as steward in his father’s place. And once installed, Jotipāla carried out the business his father had carried out, not doing any business his father had not done. He accomplished all the tasks his father had accomplished, and no others. And people said: ‘This Brahmin is truly a steward! Indeed he is a great steward!’ And that is how the young Brahmin Jotipāla came to be known as the Great Steward.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">32. “‘And one day the Great Steward went to the group of six nobles and said: ‘King Disampati is aged, decrepit, [233] stricken with age. His life is near its end and he cannot last much longer. Who can tell how long people will live? When King Disampati dies, the king-makers<a id="calibre_link-897" href="#calibre_link-1395" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">550</sup></a> are bound to anoint Prince Renu as King. You should go, gentlemen, to Prince Renu and say: ”We are the beloved, dear and favoured friends of the Lord Renu, sharing his joys and his sorrows. Our Lord King Disampati is aged... When he dies, the king-makers are bound to anoint the Lord Renu as King. If the Lord Renu should gain the kingship, let him share it with us.”’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">33. ‘“‘Very good, sir’, said the six nobles, and they went to Prince Renu and spoke to him as the Great Steward had proposed. ‘Well, gentlemen, who, apart from myself, ought to prosper but you? If, gentlemen, I gain the kingship, I will share it with you.’ [234]</div>
<div class="fmtx1">34. ‘“In due course King Disampati died, and the king-makers anointed Prince Renu King in his place. And having been made King, Renu abandoned himself to the pleasures of the five senses. Then the Great Steward went to the six nobles and said: ‘Gentlemen, now King Disampati is dead the Lord Renu, who has been anointed in his place, has abandoned himself to the pleasures of the five senses. Who knows what will come of this? The sense-pleasures are intoxicating. You should go to him and say: ”King Disampati is dead and the Lord Renu has been anointed King.

Then the King said: ‘My Lord Steward, go and divide this mighty realm of earth, so broad in the north and so narrow like the front of a cart in the south, into seven equal parts.’ ‘Very good, Sire’, said the Great Steward, and he did so.</div>

THUS HAVE I HEARD.<a id="calibre_link-926" href="#calibre_link-166" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">579</sup></a> Once the Lord was staying in Magadha, to the east of Rājagaha, by a Brahmin village called Ambasaṇḍā, to the north of the village on Mount Vediya, in the Indasāla Cave.<a id="calibre_link-927" href="#calibre_link-167" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">580</sup></a> And at that time Sakka, lord of the gods,<a id="calibre_link-928" href="#calibre_link-168" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">581</sup></a> felt a strong desire to see the Lord. And Sakka thought: ‘Where is the Blessed Lord, the fully-enlightened Buddha, now staying?’ Then, perceiving where the Lord was, Sakka said to the Thirty-Three Gods: ‘Gentlemen, the Blessed Lord is staying in Magadha...in the Indasāla Cave. How would it be if we were to go and visit the Lord?’ ‘Very good, Lord, and may good fortune go with you’, replied the Thirty-Three Gods.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.2. Then Sakka said to Pañcasikha of the gandhabbas: [264] ‘The Blessed Lord is staying in Magadha...in the Indasāla Cave. I propose to go to visit him.’ ‘Very good, Lord’, said Pañcasikha and, taking his yellow <i class="calibre9">beluva</i>-wood lute,<a id="calibre_link-929" href="#calibre_link-169" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">582</sup></a> he followed in attendance on Sakka. And, just as swiftly as a strong man might stretch forth his flexed arm, or flex it again, Sakka, surrounded by the Thirty-Three Gods and attended by Pañcasikha, vanished from the heaven of the Thirty-Three and appeared in Magadha...on Mount Vediya.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.3. Then a tremendous light shone over Mount Vediya, illuminating the village of Ambasaṇḍā &mdash; so great was the power of the gods &mdash; so that in the surrounding villages they were saying: ‘Look, Mount Vediya is on fire today &mdash; it’s burning &mdash; it’s in flames! What is the matter, that Mount Vediya and Ambasaṇḍā are lit up like this?’ and they were so terrified that their hair stood on end.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.4. Then Sakka said: ‘Pañcasikha, [265] it is hard for the  likes of us to get near the Tathāgatas when they are enjoying the bliss of meditation,<a id="calibre_link-930" href="#calibre_link-170" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">583</sup></a> and therefore withdrawn.

Thinking: ‘As far as this is neither too far nor too near to the Lord, and he will hear my voice’, he stood to one side. Then, to the strains of his lute, he sang these verses extolling the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Arahants, and love:<a id="calibre_link-932" href="#calibre_link-172" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">585</sup></a> <div class="afmtx"><div class="fmtx2">1.5. ‘Lady, your father Timbarū greet, <br class="calibre6" />Oh Sunshine<a id="calibre_link-933" href="#calibre_link-173" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">586</sup></a> fair, I give him honour due, <br class="calibre6" />By whom was sired a maid as fair as you <br class="calibre6" />Who are the cause of all my heart’s delight.</div>

</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.6. When he heard this, the Lord said: ′Pañcasikha, the sound of your strings blends so well with your song, and your song with the strings, that neither prevails excessively over the other.<a id="calibre_link-937" href="#calibre_link-177" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">590</sup></a> When did you compose these verses on the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Arahants, and love?’ ‘Lord, it was when the Blessed Lord was staying on the bank of the River Nerañjarā, under the goatherd’s <i class="calibre9">banyan</i> tree [268] prior to his enlightenment. At that time I fell in love with the lady Bhaddā, bright as the sun, the daughter of King Timbarū of the gandhabbas. But the lady was in love with somebody else. It was Sikhaddi, the son of Mātali the charioteer, whom she favoured. And when I found that I could not win the lady by any manner of means, I took my yellow <i class="calibre9">beluva-</i>wood lute and went to the home of King Timbarū of the gandhabbas, and there I sang these verses:</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.7. (Verses as 5). ‘And, Lord, having heard the verses the lady Bhaddā Suriyavaccasā said to me: “Sir, I have not personally seen that Blessed Lord, though I heard of him when I went to the Sudhammā Hall of the Thirty-Three Gods to dance. And since, sir, you praise that Blessed Lord so highly, let us meet today.” [269] And so, Lord, I met the lady, not then but later.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.8. Then Sakka thought: ‘Pañcasikha and the Lord are in friendly conversation’, so he called to Pañcasikha: ‘My dear Pañcasikha, salute the Blessed Lord from me, saying: “Lord, Sakka, king of the gods, together with his ministers and followers, pays homage at the feet of the Blessed Lord.”’ ‘Very good, Lord’, said Pañcasikha, and did so.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">′Pañcasikha, may Sakka, king of the gods, his ministers and followers be happy, for they all desire happiness: devas, humans, asuras, nāgas, gandhabbas, and whatever other groups of beings there are!’ for that is the way the Tathāgatas greet such mighty beings. After this greeting, Sakka entered the Indasāla Cave, saluted the Lord, and stood to one side, and the Thirty-Three Gods, with Pañcasikha, did the same.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.9. Then in the Indasāla Cave the rough passages became smooth, the narrow parts became wide, and in the pitch-dark cavern it became bright, owing to the [270] power of the devas. Then the Lord said to Sakka: ‘It is wonderful, it is marvellous that the Venerable Kosiya,<a id="calibre_link-938" href="#calibre_link-178" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">591</sup></a> with so much, so many things to do, should come here!’ ‘Lord, I have long wished to visit the Blessed Lord, but I have always been so busy on behalf of the Thirty-Three that I was unable to come. Once the Blessed Lord was staying at Savatthi in the Salala hut, and I went to Savatthi to see the Lord.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.10. ‘At that time the Blessed Lord was seated in some form of meditation, and King Vessavana’s wife Bhuñjatī was waiting on him, venerating him with palms together. I said to her: “Lady, please salute the Blessed Lord for me and say: ‘Sakka, the king of the gods, with his ministers and followers, pays homage at the Lord’s feet’. But she said: “Sir, it is not the right time to see the Blessed Lord, he is in retreat.” [271] “Well then, lady, when the Blessed Lord rises from his meditation, please tell him what I have said.” Lord, did the lady salute  you on my behalf, and does the Lord remember what she said?’ ‘She did salute me, King of the Gods, and I remember what she said. I also remember that it was the sound of Your Reverence’s chariot-wheels that roused me from my meditation. ′<a id="calibre_link-939" href="#calibre_link-179" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">592</sup></a></div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.11. ‘Lord, those gods who arose in the heaven of the Thirty-Three before I did have told me and assured me that whenever a Tathāgata, a fully-enlightened Arahant Buddha arises in the world, the ranks of devas increase, and those of the asuras decline in numbers. In fact I have witnessed this myself. There was, Lord, right here in Kapilavatthu a Sakyan girl called Gopikā who had faith in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, and who observed the precepts scrupulously. She rejected the status of a woman and developed the thought of becoming a man. Then, after her death, at the breaking-up of the body, she went to a happy destination, being reborn in a heaven-state among the Thirty-Three Gods, as one of our sons, becoming known as Gopaka the devas’ son.<a id="calibre_link-940" href="#calibre_link-180" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">593</sup></a> Also, there were three monks who, having observed the holy life under the Blessed Lord, had been reborn in the inferior condition of gandhabbas. They lived indulging in the pleasures of the five senses, as our attendants and servants. At this, Gopaka [272] rebuked them, saying: “What were you about, sirs, that you did not listen to the Blessed Lord’s teaching? I was a woman who had faith in the Buddha...I rejected the status of a woman ... and was reborn among the Thirty-Three Gods and am known as Gopaka the devas’ son. But you, after having observed the holy life under the Blessed Lord, have been reborn in the inferior condition of gandhabbas! It is a sorry sight for us to see our fellows in the Dhamma reborn in the inferior condition of gandhabbas!” And being thus rebuked, two of those devas immediately developed mindfulness,  <a id="calibre_link-941" href="#calibre_link-181" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">594</sup></a> and so attained to the Realm of the Retinue of Brahma.  <a id="calibre_link-942" href="#calibre_link-182" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">595</sup></a> But one of them remained addicted to sensual pleasures.</div>
<div class="atx"><div class="fmtx2">1.12 [Gopaka spoke:] <br class="calibre6" />′′′Disciple once of Him-Who-Sees, <br class="calibre6" />The name I bore then Gopikā.  <br class="calibre6" />In Buddha, Dhamma firmly trusting <br class="calibre6" />I served the Sangha cheerfully. <br class="calibre6" />For loyal service paid to him <br class="calibre6" />See me now, a Sakka-son, <br class="calibre6" />Mighty, in the Threefold Heaven,<a id="calibre_link-943" href="#calibre_link-183" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">596</sup></a>  <br class="calibre6" />Resplendent; Gopaka my name. <br class="calibre6" />Then former monks I saw, who’d reached <br class="calibre6" />No higher than gandhabba’s rank, <br class="calibre6" />Who before had human birth <br class="calibre6" />And led the life the Buddha taught. <br class="calibre6" />We supplied their food and drink <br class="calibre6" />And waited on them in our homes.<a id="calibre_link-944" href="#calibre_link-184" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">597</sup></a> [273] <br class="calibre6" />Had they no ears, that they thus blest <br class="calibre6" />Still could not grasp the Buddha’s law? <br class="calibre6" />Each for himself must understand <br class="calibre6" />That Dhamma taught by Him-Who-Sees, <br class="calibre6" />And well-proclaimed.

<div class="fmtx2">When thus rebuked by Gopaka, <br class="calibre6" />Disciple true of Gotama, <br class="calibre6" />In sore distress they all replied: <br class="calibre6" />“Alas, let’s go, and strive amain, <br class="calibre6" />And be no longer others’ slaves!” [274]  <br class="calibre6" />And of the three, two struggled hard, <br class="calibre6" />And bore in mind the Teacher’s word. <br class="calibre6" />They purified their hearts of lust, <br class="calibre6" />Perceiving peril in desires, <br class="calibre6" />And like the elephant that bursts <br class="calibre6" />All restraining bonds, they broke <br class="calibre6" />The fetters and the bonds of lust, <br class="calibre6" />Those fetters of the evil one <br class="calibre6" />So hard to overcome &mdash; and thus <br class="calibre6" />The very gods, the Thirty-Three, <br class="calibre6" />With Indra and Pajāpati, <br class="calibre6" />Who sat enthroned in Council Hall, <br class="calibre6" />These two heroes, passions purged, <br class="calibre6" />Outstripped, and left them far behind.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">On seeing which, Vasava,<a id="calibre_link-945" href="#calibre_link-185" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">598</sup></a> dismayed, <br class="calibre6" />Chief amidst that throng of gods, <br class="calibre6" />Cried: “See how these of lesser rank <br class="calibre6" />Outstrip the gods, the Thirty-Three!” <br class="calibre6" />Then hearing of his ruler’s fears, <br class="calibre6" />Gopaka said to Vasava: <br class="calibre6" />“Lord Indra, in the world of men <br class="calibre6" />A Buddha, called the Sakyan Sage,<a id="calibre_link-946" href="#calibre_link-186" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">599</sup></a>  <br class="calibre6" />Has gained the mastery of lust, <br class="calibre6" />And these his pupils, who had failed <br class="calibre6" />In mindfulness when claimed by death, <br class="calibre6" />Have now regained it with my help.

<div class="fmtx2">Even here, they gained the truth, and so <br class="calibre6" />Have passed beyond to greater eminence.  <br class="calibre6" />Those two have gained a higher place than this <br class="calibre6" />In Realms of Brahmā′s Retinue.

</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.13. Then the Lord thought: ‘Sakka has lived a pure life for a long time. Whatever questions he may ask will be to the point and not frivolous, and he will be quick to understand my answers.’ So the Blessed Lord replied to Sakka in this verse:<div class="afmtx"><div class="fmtx2">‘Ask me, Sakka, all that you desire! <br class="calibre6" />On what you ask, I′ll put your mind at rest.’</div>

<div class="calibre3">&nbsp;<br class="calibre3" /></div><div class="calibre3">&nbsp;<br class="calibre3" /></div><div class="fmtx">2.1. Being thus invited, Sakka, ruler of the gods, put his first question to the Lord: ‘By what fetters, sir,<a id="calibre_link-948" href="#calibre_link-188" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">601</sup></a> are beings bound &mdash; gods, humans, asuras, nāgas, gandhabbas and whatever other kinds there may be &mdash; whereby, although they wish to live without hate, harming, hostility or malignity, and in peace, they yet live in hate, harming one another, hostile and malign? ′ This was Sakka’s first question to the Lord, and the Lord replied: ‘Ruler of the Gods, it is the bonds of jealousy and avarice<a id="calibre_link-949" href="#calibre_link-189" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">602</sup></a> that bind beings so that, though they wish to live without hate,... they yet live in hate, harming one another, hostile and malign.’ This was the Lord’s reply, and Sakka, delighted, exclaimed: ‘So it is, Lord, so it is, Well-Farer! Through the Lord’s answer I have overcome my doubt and got rid of uncertainty!’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.2. Then Sakka, having [277] expressed his appreciation, asked another question: ‘But sir, what gives rise to jealousy and avarice, what is their origin, how are they born, how do they arise? Owing to the presence of what do they arise, owing to the absence of what do they not arise?’ ‘Jealousy and avarice, Ruler of the Gods, take rise from like and dislike,<a id="calibre_link-950" href="#calibre_link-190" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">603</sup></a>  this is their origin, this is how they are born, how they arise. When these are present, they arise; when these are absent,  they do not arise.’ ‘But, sir, what gives rise to like and dislike?... Owing to the presence of what do they arise, owing to the absence of what do they not arise?’ ‘They arise, Ruler of the Gods, from desire<a id="calibre_link-951" href="#calibre_link-191" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">604</sup></a>... Owing to the presence of desire they arise, owing to the absence of desire they do not arise.’ ‘But, sir, what gives rise to desire?...’ ‘Desire, Ruler of the Gods, arises from thinking<a id="calibre_link-952" href="#calibre_link-192" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">605</sup></a>... When the mind thinks about something, desire arises; when the mind thinks about nothing, desire does not arise.’ ‘But, sir, what gives rise to thinking? ...′ ′Thinking, Ruler of the Gods, arises from the tendency to proliferation<a id="calibre_link-953" href="#calibre_link-193" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">606</sup></a> ... When this tendency is present, thinking arises; when it is absent, thinking does not arise.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.3. ‘Well, sir, what practice has that monk undertaken,<a id="calibre_link-954" href="#calibre_link-194" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">607</sup></a>  who has reached the right way which is needful and leading to the cessation of the tendency to proliferation?’ [278]</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Ruler of the Gods, I declare that there are two kinds of happiness:<a id="calibre_link-955" href="#calibre_link-195" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">608</sup></a> the kind to be pursued, and the kind to be avoided. The same applies to unhappiness<a id="calibre_link-956" href="#calibre_link-196" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">609</sup></a> and equanimity.<a id="calibre_link-957" href="#calibre_link-197" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">610</sup></a>  Why have I declared this in regard to happiness? This is how I understood happiness: When I observed that in the pursuit of such happiness, unwholesome factors increased and wholesome factors decreased, then that happiness was to be avoided. And when I observed that in the pursuit of such happiness unwholesome factors decreased and wholesome ones increased, then that happiness was to be sought after. Now, of such happiness as is accompanied by thinking and pondering,<a id="calibre_link-958" href="#calibre_link-198" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">611</sup></a> and of that which is not so accompanied, the latter is the more excellent. The same applies to unhappiness, and [279] to equanimity. And this, Ruler of the Gods, is the practice that monk has undertaken who has reached the right way...leading to the cessation of the tendency to proliferation.’ And Sakka expressed his delight at the Lord’s answer.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.4. Then Sakka, having expressed his appreciation, asked another question: ‘Well, sir, what practice has that monk undertaken who has acquired the restraint required by the rules?′<a id="calibre_link-959" href="#calibre_link-199" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">612</sup></a></div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Ruler of the Gods, I declare that there are two kinds of bodily conduct: the kind to be pursued, and the kind to be avoided. The same applies to conduct of speech and to the  pursuit of goals. [280] Why have I declared this in regard to bodily conduct? This is how I understood bodily conduct: When I observed that by the performance of certain actions, unwholesome factors increased and wholesome factors decreased, then that form of bodily action was to be avoided. And when I observed that by the performance of such actions unwholesome factors decreased and wholesome ones increased, then such bodily action was to be followed. That is why I make this distinction. The same applies to conduct of speech and the pursuit of goals. [281] And this, Ruler of the Gods, is the practice that monk has undertaken who has acquired the restraint required by the rules.’ And Sakka expressed his delight at the Lord’s answer.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.5. Then Sakka asked another question: ‘Well, sir, what practice has that monk undertaken who has acquired control of his sense-faculties?’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Ruler of the Gods, I declare that things perceived by the eye are of two kinds: the kind to be pursued, and the kind to be avoided. The same applies to things perceived by the ear, the nose, the tongue, the body and the mind.’ At this, Sakka said: ‘Lord, I understand in full the true meaning of what the Blessed Lord has outlined in brief. Lord, whatever object perceived by the eye, if its pursuit leads to the increase of unwholesome factors and the decrease of wholesome ones, that is not to be sought after; if its pursuit leads to the decrease of unwholesome factors and the increase of wholesome ones, such an object is [282] to be sought after. And the same applies to things perceived by the ear, the nose, the tongue, the body and the mind. Thus I understand in full the true meaning of what the Blessed Lord has outlined in brief, and thus through the Lord’s answer I have overcome my doubt and got rid of uncertainty.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.6. Then Sakka asked another question: ‘Sir, do all ascetics and Brahmins teach the same doctrine, practise the same discipline, want the same thing<a id="calibre_link-960" href="#calibre_link-200" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">613</sup></a> and pursue the same goal?’ ‘No, Ruler of the Gods, they do not.’ ‘But why, sir, do they not do so?’ ‘The world, Ruler of the Gods, is made up of many and various elements. Such being the case, beings adhere to one or other of these various things, and whatever they adhere  to they become powerfully addicted to, and declare: ‘This alone is the truth, everything else is false!’ Therefore they do not all teach the same doctrine, practise the same discipline, want the same thing, pursue the same goal.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Sir, are all ascetics and Brahmins fully [283] proficient, freed from bonds, perfect in the holy life, have they perfectly reached the goal?’ ‘No, Ruler of the Gods.’ ‘Why is that, sir?’ ‘Only those, Ruler of the Gods, who are liberated by the destruction of craving are fully proficient, freed from the bonds, perfect in the holy life, and have perfectly reached the goal.’ And Sakka rejoiced at the answer as before.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.7. Then Sakka said: ′Passion,<a id="calibre_link-961" href="#calibre_link-201" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">614</sup></a> sir, is a disease, a boil, a dart. It seduces a man, drawing him into this or that state of becoming, so that he is reborn in high states or low. Whereas other ascetics and Brahmins of differing viewpoints gave me no chance to ask these questions, the Lord has instructed me at length, and thus removed the dart of doubt and uncertainty from me.’ [284] ‘Ruler of the Gods, do you admit to having asked the same question of other ascetics and Brahmins?’ ‘Yes, Lord.’ ‘Then, if you don′t mind, please tell me what they said.’ ‘I do not mind telling the Blessed Lord, or one like him.′<a id="calibre_link-962" href="#calibre_link-202" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">615</sup></a> ‘Then tell me, Ruler of the Gods.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Lord, I went to those I considered to be ascetics and Brahmins because of their solitary life in the woods, and I put these questions to them. But instead of giving me a proper answer,<a id="calibre_link-963" href="#calibre_link-203" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">616</sup></a> they asked me in return: “Who are you, Venerable Sir?” I replied that I was Sakka, ruler of the gods, and they asked me what had brought me there. Then I taught them the Dhamma as far as I had heard it and practised it. But they were very pleased with even that much, and they said: “We have seen Sakka, the ruler of the gods, and he has answered the questions we put to him!” And they became my pupils instead of my becoming theirs. But I, Lord, am a disciple of the Blessed Lord, a Stream-Winner, not subject to rebirth in states of woe, firmly established and destined for full enlightenment. ′<a id="calibre_link-964" href="#calibre_link-204" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">617</sup></a> ‘Ruler of the Gods, do you admit to having ever previously experienced rejoicing and happiness such as you experience now?’ [285] ‘Yes, Lord.’ ‘And what was that about?’ ‘In the past, Lord, war had broken out between the gods and  the asuras, and the gods had defeated the asuras. And after the battle, as victor, I thought: “Whatever is now the food of the gods,<a id="calibre_link-965" href="#calibre_link-205" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">618</sup></a> and what is the food of the asuras, henceforth we shall enjoy both.” But, Lord, such happiness and satisfaction, which was due to blows and wounds, does not conduce to dispassion, detachment, cessation, peace, higher knowledge, enlightenment, Nibbana. But that happiness and satisfaction that is obtained by hearing the Dhamma from the Blessed Lord, which is not due to blows and wounds, does conduce to dispassion, detachment, cessation, peace, higher knowledge, enlightenment, Nibbāna.′</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.8. ‘And, Ruler of the Gods, what things do you call to mind when you admit to experiencing such satisfaction and happiness as this?’ ‘Lord, at such a time, six things come to mind at which I rejoice:<div class="afmtx"><div class="fmtx2">“I who merely as a god exist, have gained <br class="calibre6" />The chance, by kamma, of another earthly life.′′<a id="calibre_link-966" href="#calibre_link-206" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">619</sup></a></div>

<div class="fmtx">That, Lord, is the sixth thing that occurs to me, and these are the six things at which I rejoice.</div>
<div class="atx"><div class="fmtx2">2.9. ‘Long I wandered, unfulfilled, in doubt, <br class="calibre6" />In quest of the Tathagata.

<div class="fmtx1">2.10. Then Sakka, ruler of the gods, said to Pañcasikha of the gandhabbas: ‘My dear Pañcasikha, you have been of great help to me for gaining the ear of the Blessed Lord.

<div class="fmtx1">And then Sakka, ruler of the gods, touched the earth with his hand and called out three times:<div class="afmtx"><div class="fmtx2">′Homage to the Blessed One, the Arahant, the supremely enlightened Buddha!</div>

<div class="cst"><b class="calibre5">Debate with a Sceptic</b></div>
<div class="fmtx">[316] 1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. Once the Venerable Kumāra-Kassapa  <a id="calibre_link-1057" href="#calibre_link-2" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">710</sup></a> was touring round Kosala with a large company of about five hundred monks, and he came to stay at a town called Setavya. He stayed to the north of Setavya in the Siṁsapā Forest.<a id="calibre_link-1058" href="#calibre_link-3" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">711</sup></a> And at that time Prince Payasi was living at Setavya, a populous place, full of grass, timber, water and corn, which had been given to him by King Pasenadi of Kosala as a royal gift and with royal powers.<a id="calibre_link-1059" href="#calibre_link-4" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">712</sup></a></div>
<div class="fmtx1">2. And Prince Payasi developed the following evil opinion: ‘There is no other world, there are no spontaneously born beings, there is no fruit or result [317] of good or evil deeds.′<a id="calibre_link-1060" href="#calibre_link-5" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">713</sup></a>  Meanwhile, the Brahmins and householders of Setavya heard the news: ‘The ascetic Kumāra-Kassapa, a disciple of the ascetic Gotama, is touring round Kosala with a large company of about five hundred monks; he has arrived at Setavya and is staying to the north of Setavya in the Simsapā Forest; and concerning the Reverend Kassapa a good report has been spread about: “He is learned, experienced, wise, well-informed, a fine speaker, able to give good replies, venerable, an Arahant.” And it is good to see such Arahants.’ And so the Brahmins and householders of Setavya, leaving Setavya by the north gate in large numbers, made for the Simsapā Forest.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">3. And just then, Prince Payasi had gone up to the verandah for his midday rest. Seeing all the Brahmins and householders making for the Simsapa Forest, he asked his steward why. [318] The steward said: ‘Sir, it is the ascetic Kumāra-Kassapa, a disciple of the ascetic Gotama, ... and concerning him a good report has been spread about... That is why they are going to see him.’ ‘Well then, steward, you go to the  Brahmins and householders of Setavya and say: “Gentlemen, Prince Payasi says: ‘Please wait, the Prince will come to see the ascetic Kumara-Kassapa.’” Already this ascetic Kumāra-Kassapa has been teaching these foolish and inexperienced Brahmins and householders of Setavya that there is another world, that there are spontaneously born beings, and that there is fruit and result of good and evil deeds. But no such things exist.’ ‘Very good, sir’, said the steward, and delivered the message.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">4. Then Prince Payasi, accompanied by the Brahmins and householders of Setavya, went to the Simsapa Forest where the Venerable Kumāra-Kassapa was. Having exchanged courtesies with the Venerable Kumara Kassapa, [319] he sat down to one side. And some of the Brahmins and householders saluted the Venerable Kumāra-Kassapa and then sat down to one side, while some first exchanged courtesies with him, some saluted him with joined palms, some announced their name and clan, and some silently sat down to one side.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">5. Then Price Payasi said to the Venerable Kumāra-Kassapa: ‘Reverend Kassapa, I hold to this tenet and this view: There is no other world, there are no spontaneously born beings, there is no fruit or result of good or evil deeds.’ ‘Well, Prince, I have never seen or heard of such a tenet or view as you declare. And so, Prince, I will question you about it, and you shall reply as you think fit. What do you think, Prince? Are the sun and the moon in this world or another, are they gods or humans?’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Reverend Kassapa, they are in another world, and they are gods, not humans.’ ‘In the same way, Prince, you should consider: “There is another world, there are spontaneously born beings, there is fruit and result of good and evil deeds.′′′</div>
<div class="fmtx1">6. ‘Whatever you may say about that, Reverend Kassapa, I still think there is no other world...’ ′Have you any reasons for this assertion, Prince?’ [320] ‘I have, Reverend Kassapa.’ ′How is that, Prince?’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Reverend Kassapa, I have friends, colleagues and blood-relations who take life, take what is not given, commit sexual offences, tell lies, use abusive, harsh and frivolous speech, who are greedy, full of hatred and hold wrong views. Eventually  they become ill, suffering, diseased. And when I am sure they will not recover, I go to them and say: “There are certain ascetics and Brahmins who declare and believe that those who take life, ... hold wrong views will, after death at the breaking-up of the body, be born in a state of woe, an evil place, a place of punishment, in hell. Now you have done these things, and if what these ascetics and Brahmins say is true, that is where you will go. Now if, after death, you go to a state of woe, ... come to me and declare that there is another world, there are spontaneously born beings, there is fruit and result of good and evil deeds. You, gentlemen, are trustworthy and dependable, and what you have seen shall be as if I had seen it myself, so it will be.” But although they agreed, [321] they neither came to tell me, nor did they send a messenger. That, Reverend Kassapa, is my reason for maintaining: “There is no other world, there are no spontaneously born beings, there is no fruit or result of good or evil deeds.”’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">7. ‘As to that, Prince, I will question you about it, and you shall reply as you think fit. What do you think, Prince? Suppose they were to bring a thief before you caught in the act, and say: “This man, Lord, is a thief caught in the act. Sentence him to any punishment you wish.” And you might say: “Bind this man’s arms tightly behind him with a strong rope, shave his head closely, and lead him to the rough sound of a drum through the streets and squares and out through the southern gate, and there cut off his head.” And they, saying: “Very good” in assent, might... lead him out through the southern gate, and there cut off his head.” Now if that thief were to say to the executioners: ”Good executioners, in this town or village I have friends, colleagues and blood-relations, please wait till I have visited them”, would he get his wish? [322] Or would they just cut off that talkative thief’s head?’ ′He would not get his wish, Reverend Kassapa. They would just cut off his head.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘So, Prince, this thief could not get even his human executioners to wait while he visited his friends and relations. So how can your friends, colleagues and blood-relations who have committed all these misdeeds, having died and gone to a place of woe, prevail upon the warders of hell, saying: “Good  warders of hell, please wait while we report to Prince Payasi that there is another world, there are spontaneously born beings, and there is fruit and result of good and evil deeds”? Therefore, Prince, admit that there is another world...’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">8. ‘Whatever you may say about that, Reverend Kassapa, I still think there is no other world...’ ′Have you any reason for this assertion, Prince?’ ‘I have, Reverend Kassapa.’ ‘What is that, Prince?’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Reverend Kassapa, I have friends ... who abstain from taking life, from taking what is not given, from committing sexual [323] offences, from telling lies or using abusive, harsh and frivolous speech, who are not greedy or full of hatred and who have right views.<a id="calibre_link-1061" href="#calibre_link-6" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">714</sup></a> Eventually they become ill... and when I am sure they will not recover, I go to them and say: “There are certain ascetics and Brahmins who declare and believe that those who abstain from taking life ... and have right views will, after death at the breaking-up of the body, be born in a happy state, a heavenly world. Now you have refrained from doing these things, and if what these ascetics and Brahmins say is true, that is where you will go. Now if, after death, you go to a happy state, a heavenly world, come to me and declare that there is another world...You, gentlemen, are trustworthy and dependable, and what you have seen shall be as if I had seen it myself, so it will be.” But although they agreed, they neither came to me, nor did they send a messenger. That, Reverend Kassapa, is my reason for maintaining: [324] “There is no other world...′′′</div>
<div class="fmtx1">9. ‘Well then, Prince, I will give you a parable, because some wise people understand what is said by means of parables. Suppose a man had fallen head first into a cesspit, and you were to say to your men: “Pull that man out of the cesspit! ” and they would say: “Very good”, and do so. Then you would tell them to clean his body thoroughly of the filth with bamboo scrapers, and then to give him a triple shampoo with yellow loam. Then you would tell them to anoint his body with oil and then to clean him three times with fine soap-powder. Then you would tell them to dress his hair and beard, and to adorn him with fine garlands, ointments and clothes. 1325] Finally you would tell them to lead him up to  your palace and let him indulge in the pleasures of the five senses, and they would do so. What do you think, Prince? Would that man, having been well washed, with his hair and beard dressed, adorned and garlanded, clothed in white, and having been conveyed up to the palace, enjoying and revelling in the pleasures of the five senses, want to be plunged once more into that cesspit?’ ‘No, Reverend Kassapa.’ ‘Why not?’ ‘Because that cesspit is unclean and considered so, evil-smelling, horrible, revolting, and generally considered to be so.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">′In just the same way, Prince, human beings are unclean, evil-smelling, horrible, revolting and generally considered to be so by the devas. So why should your friends ... who have not committed any of the offences... (as verse 8), and who have after death been born in a happy state, a heavenly world, come back and say: “There is another world,...there is fruit [326] of good and evil deeds”? Therefore, Prince, admit that there is another world...’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">10. ‘Whatever you may say about that, Reverend Kassapa, I still think there is no other world...’ ‘Have you any reason for this assertion, Prince?’ ‘I have, Reverend Kassapa.’ ‘What is that, Prince?’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Reverend Kassapa, I have friends who abstain ... from telling lies, from strong drink and sloth-inducing drugs. Eventually they become ill... “There are certain ascetics and Brahmins who declare and believe that those who abstain from taking life...and sloth-producing drugs will...be born in a happy state, in a heavenly world, as companions of the Thirty-Three Gods... ′′[327] But although they agreed, they neither came to tell me, nor did they send a messenger. That, Reverend Kassapa, is my reason for maintaining: ”There is no other world...′′′</div>
<div class="fmtx1">11. ‘As to that, Prince, I will question you about it, and you shall answer as you think fit. That which is for human beings, Prince, a hundred years is for the Thirty-Three Gods one day and night. Thirty of such nights make a month, twelve such months a year, and a thousand such years are the life-span of the Thirty-Three Gods. Now suppose they were to think: “After we have indulged in the pleasures of the five senses for  two or three days we will go to Pāyāsi and tell him there is another world, there are spontaneously born beings, there is fruit and result of good and evil deeds”, would they have done so?’ ‘No, Reverend Kassapa, because we should be long-since dead. But, Reverend Kassapa, who has told you that the Thirty-Three Gods exist, and that they are so long-lived? I don’t [328] believe the Thirty-Three Gods exist or are so long-lived.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Prince, imagine a man who was blind from birth and could not see dark or light objects, or blue, yellow, red or crimson ones, could not see the smooth and the rough, could not see the stars and the moon. He might say: “There are no dark and light objects and nobody who can see them, ... there is no sun or moon, and nobody who can see them. I am not aware of this thing, and therefore it does not exist.” Would he be speaking rightly, Prince?’ ‘No, Reverend Kassapa. There are dark and light objects . . . ,[329] there is a sun and a moon, and anyone who said: “I am not aware of this thing, I cannot see it, and therefore it does not exist” would not be speaking rightly.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Well, Prince, it appears that your reply is like that of the blind man when you ask how I know about the Thirty-Three Gods and their longevity. Prince, the other world cannot be seen the way you think, with the physical eye. Prince, those ascetics and Brahmins who seek in the jungle-thickets and the recesses of the forest for a resting-place that is quiet, with little noise &mdash; they stay there unwearied, ardent, restrained, purifying the divine eye,<a id="calibre_link-1062" href="#calibre_link-7" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">715</sup></a> and with that purified divine eye that exceeds the powers of human sight, they see both this world and the next, and spontaneously born beings. That, Prince, is how the other world can be seen, and not the way you think, with the physical eye. Therefore, Prince, admit that there is another world, that there are spontaneously born beings, and that there is fruit and result of good and evil deeds.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">12. ‘Whatever you may say about that, Reverend Kassapa, [330] I still think there is no other world...’ ‘Have you any reason for this assertion, Prince?’ ‘I have, Reverend Kassapa.’ ‘What is that, Prince?’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Well, Reverend Kassapa, I see here some ascetics and Brahmins  who observe morality and are well-conducted, who want to live, do not want to die, who desire comfort and hate suffering. And it seems to me that if these good ascetics and Brahmins who are so moral and well-conducted know that after death they will be better off, then these good people would now take poison, take a knife and kill themselves, hang themselves or jump off a cliff. But though they have such knowledge, they still want to live, do not want to die, they desire comfort and hate suffering. And that, Reverend Kassapa, is my reason for maintaining: “There is no other world. . .”’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">13. ‘Well then, Prince, I will give you a parable, because some wise people understand what is said by means of parables. Once upon a time, Prince, a certain Brahmin had two wives. One had a son ten or twelve years old, while the other was pregnant and nearing her time when the Brahmin died. Then this youth said to his mother’s co-wife: “Lady, whatever wealth and possessions, silver or gold, there may be, is all [331] mine. My father made me his heir.” At this the Brahmin lady said to the youth: “Wait, young man, until I give birth. If the child is a boy, one portion will be his, and if it is a girl, she will become your servant.” The youth repeated his words a second time, and received the same reply. When he repeated them a third time, the lady took a knife and, going into an inner room, cut open her belly, thinking: “If only I could find out whether it is a boy or a girl!” And thus she destroyed herself and the living embryo, and the wealth as well, just as fools do who seek their inheritance unwisely, heedless of hidden danger.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘In the same way you, Prince, will foolishly enter on hidden dangers by unwisely seeking for another [332] world, just as that Brahmin lady did in seeking her inheritance. But, Prince, those ascetics and Brahmins who observe morality and are well-conducted do not seek to hasten the ripening of that which is not yet ripe, but rather they wisely await its ripening. Their life is profitable to those ascetics and Brahmins, for the longer such moral and well-conducted ascetics and Brahmins remain alive, the greater the merit that they create; they practise for the welfare of the many, for the happiness of the  many, out of compassion for the world, for the profit and benefit of devas and humans. Therefore, Prince, admit that there is another world...’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">14. ‘Whatever you may say about that, Reverend Kassapa, I still think there is no other world...’ ′Have you any reason for this assertion, Prince?’ ‘I have, Reverend Kassapa.’ ‘What is that, Prince?’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Reverend Kassapa, take the case that they bring a thief before me, caught in the act and say: “Here, Lord, is a thief caught in the act, sentence him to whatever punishment you wish.” And I say: “Take this man and put him alive in a jar. Seal the mouth and close it with a damp skin, give it a thick covering of damp clay, [333] put it in an oven and light the fire.” And they do so. When we are sure the man is dead, we remove the jar, break the clay, uncover the mouth, and watch carefully: “Maybe we can see his soul<a id="calibre_link-1063" href="#calibre_link-8" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">716</sup></a> escaping.” But we do not see any soul escaping, and that is why, Reverend Kassapa, I believe there is no other world...’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">15. ‘As to that, Prince, I will question you about it, and you shall reply as you think fit. Do you admit that when you have gone for your midday rest you have seen pleasant visions of parks, forests, delightful country and lotus-ponds?’ ′I do, Reverend Kassapa.’ ‘And at that time are you not watched over by hunchbacks, dwarfs, young girls and maidens?’ ‘I am, Reverend Kassapa.’ ‘And do they observe your soul entering or leaving your body?’ [334] ‘No, Reverend Kassapa.’ ‘So they do not see your soul entering or leaving your body even when you are alive. Therefore how could you see the soul of a dead man entering or leaving his body? Therefore, Prince, admit that there is another world...’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">16. ‘Whatever you may say about that, Reverend Kassapa, I still think there is no other world...’ ‘Have you any reason for this assertion, Prince?’ ‘I have, Reverend Kassapa.’ ‘What is that, Prince?’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Reverend Kassapa, take the case that they bring a thief before me... and I say: “Weigh this man on the scales alive, then strangle him, and weigh him again.” And they do so. As long as he was alive, he was lighter, softer and more flexible, but when he was dead he was heavier, stiffer<a id="calibre_link-1064" href="#calibre_link-9" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">717</sup></a> and more inflexible.  And that, Reverend Kassapa, is my reason for maintaining that there is no other world...’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">17. ‘Well then, Prince, I will give you a parable... [335] Suppose a man weighed an iron ball that had been heated all day, blazing, burning fiercely, glowing. And suppose that after a time, when it had grown cold and gone out, he weighed it again. At which time would it be lighter, softer and more flexible: when it was hot, burning and glowing, or when it was cold and extinguished?’ ‘Reverend Kassapa, when that ball of iron is hot, burning and glowing with the elements of fire and air, then it is lighter, softer and more flexible. When, without those elements,<a id="calibre_link-1065" href="#calibre_link-10" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">718</sup></a> it has grown cold and gone out, it is heavier, stiffer and more inflexible.’ ‘Well then, Prince, it is just the same with the body. When it has life, heat and consciousness, it is lighter, softer and more flexible. But when it is deprived of life, heat and consciousness, it is heavier, stiffer and more inflexible. In the same way, Prince, you should consider: “There is another world...′′′</div>

<div class="fmtx1">19. ‘Well then, Prince, I will give you a parable... Once there was a trumpeter who took his trumpet<a id="calibre_link-1068" href="#calibre_link-13" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">721</sup></a> and went into the border country.<a id="calibre_link-1069" href="#calibre_link-14" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">722</sup></a> On coming to a village, he stood in the village centre, blew his trumpet three times and then, putting it down on the ground, sat down to one side. Then, Prince, those border folk thought: “Where does that sound come from that is so delightful, so sweet, so intoxicating, so compelling, so captivating?” They addressed the trumpeter and asked him about this. “Friends, this trumpet is where those delightful sounds come from.” So then they laid the trumpet on its back, crying: “Speak, mister trumpet, speak!” But the trumpet never uttered a sound. Then they turned it face downwards,...on its side,... on its other side,... stood it up,... stood it on its head, . . . [338] thumped it with their fists,... stoned it,... beat it with sticks,... struck it with swords,... shook it this way and that, crying: “Speak, mister trumpet, speak!” But the trumpet never uttered a sound. The trumpeter thought: “What fools these border folk are! How stupidly they search for the sound of the trumpet!” And as they watched him, he took the trumpet, blew it three times, and went away. And those border folk thought: “It seems that when the trumpet is accompanied by a man, by effort, and by the wind, then it makes a sound. But when it is not accompanied by a man, by effort, and by the wind, then it makes no sound.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘In the same way, Prince, when this body has life, heat and consciousness, then it goes and comes back, stands and sits and lies down, sees things with its eyes, hears with its ears, smells with its nose, tastes with its tongue, feels with its body, and knows mental objects with its mind. But when it has no life, heat or consciousness, it does none of these things. In the same way, Prince, you should consider: “There is another world...′′′</div>

And that is why, Reverend Kassapa, I believe there is no other world...’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">21. ‘Well then, Prince, I will give you a parable... Once there was a matted-haired fire-worshipper<a id="calibre_link-1070" href="#calibre_link-15" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">723</sup></a> who dwelt in the forest in a leaf-hut. And a certain tribe was on the move, and its leader stayed for one night near the fire-worshipper’s dwelling, and then left. So the fire-worshipper thought [340] he would go to the site to see if he could find anything he could make use of. He got up early and went to the site, and there he saw a tiny delicate baby boy lying abandoned on his back. At the sight he thought: “It would not be right for me to look on and let a human being die. I had better take this child to my hermitage, take care of him, feed him and bring him up.” So he did so. When the boy was ten or twelve, the hermit had some business to do in the neighbourhood. So he said to the boy: “I want to go to the neighbourhood, my son. You look after the fire and don′t let it go out. If it should go out, here is an axe, here are some sticks, here are the fire-sticks, so you can relight the fire and look after it.” Having thus instructed the boy, the hermit went into the neighbourhood. But the boy, being absorbed in his games, let the fire go out. Then he thought: “Father said: ′... here is an axe ... so you can relight the fire and look after it.’ Now I’d better do so!” [341] So he chopped up the fire-sticks with the axe, thinking: “I expect I’ll get a fire this way.” But he got no fire. He cut the fire-sticks into two, into three, into four, into five, ten, a hundred pieces, he splintered them, he pounded them in a mortar, he winnowed them in a great wind, thinking: “I expect I’ll get a fire this way.” But he got no fire, and when the hermit came back, having finished his business, he said: “Son, why have you let the fire go out?” and the boy told him what had happened. The hermit thought: “How stupid this boy is, how senseless! What a thoughtless way to try to get a fire!′′ So, while the boy looked on, he took the fire-sticks and rekindled the fire, saying : ”Son, that’s the way [342] to rekindle a fire, not the stupid, senseless, thoughtless way you tried to do it!”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">′In just the same way, Prince, you are looking foolishly, senselessly and unreasonably for another world. Prince, give  up this evil viewpoint, give it up! Do not let it cause you misfortune and suffering for a long time!’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">22. ‘Even though you say this, Reverend Kassapa, still I cannot bear to give up this evil opinion. King Pasenadi of Kosala knows my opinions, and so do kings abroad. If I give it up, they will say: ′′What a fool Prince Pāyāsi is, how stupidly he grasps at wrong views!” I will stick to this view out of anger, contempt and spite!’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">23. ‘Well then, Prince, I will give you a parable...Once, Prince, a great caravan of a thousand carts was travelling from east to west. And wherever they went, they rapidly consumed all the grass, wood and greenstuff. Now this caravan had two leaders, each [343] in charge of five hundred carts. And they thought: “This is a great caravan of a thousand carts. Wherever we go we use up all the supplies. Perhaps we should divide the caravan into two groups of five hundred carts each”, and they did so. Then one of the leaders collected plenty of grass, wood and water, and set off. After two or three days’ journey he saw a dark red-eyed man coming towards him wearing a quiver and a wreath of white water-lilies, with his clothes and hair all wet, driving a donkey-chariot whose wheels were splashed with mud. On seeing this man, the leader said: “Where do you come from, sir?” “From such-and-such.” “And where are you going?” “To so-and-so.” “Has there been much rainfall in the jungle ahead?” “Oh yes, sir, there has been a great deal of rain in the jungle ahead of you, the roads are well watered and there is plenty of grass, [344] wood and water. Throw away the grass, wood and water you have already got, sir! You will make rapid progress with lightly-laden carts, so do not tire your draught-oxen!” The caravan-leader told the carters what the man had said: ″Throw away the grass, wood and water...”, and they did so. But at the first camping-place they did not find any grass, wood or water, nor at the second, the third, fourth, fifth, sixth or seventh, and thus they all came to ruin and destruction. And whatever there was of them, men and cattle, they were all gobbled up by that yakkha-spirit,  <a id="calibre_link-1071" href="#calibre_link-16" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">724</sup></a> and only their bones remained.<a id="calibre_link-1072" href="#calibre_link-17" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">725</sup></a></div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘And when the leader of the second caravan was sure the first caravan had gone forward far enough, he stocked up with  plenty of grass, wood and water. Aftr two or three days’ journey this leader saw a dark red-eyed man coming towards him... [345] who advised him to throw away his stocks of grass, wood and water. Then the leader said to the carters: “This man told us that we should throw away the grass, wood and water we already have. But he is not one of our friends and relatives, so why should we trust him? So do not throw away the grass, wood and water we have; let the caravan continue on its way with the goods we have brought, and do not throw any of them away!” The carters agreed and did as he said. And at the first camping-place they did not find any grass, [346] wood or water, nor at the second, the third, fourth, fifth, sixth or seventh, but there they saw the other caravan that had come to ruin and destruction, and they saw the bones of those men and cattle that had been gobbled up by the yakkha-spirit. Then the caravan leader said to the carters: “That caravan came to ruin and destruction through the folly of its leader. So now let us leave behind such of our goods as are of little value, and take whatever is of greater value from the other caravan.” And they did so. And with that wise leader they passed safely through the jungle.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘In the same way you, Prince, will come to ruin and destruction if you foolishly and unwisely seek the other world in the wrong way. Those who think they can trust anything they hear are heading for ruin and destruction just like those carters. Prince, give up this evil viewpoint, give it up!

And he spread out his cloak, gathered up the dung in it, made it into a bundle and put it on his head, and went on. But on his way back there was a heavy shower of unseasonable rain, and he went on his way bespattered  with oozing, dripping dung to his finger-tips, and still carrying his load of dung. Those who saw him said: “You must be mad! You must be crazy! Why do you go along carrying that load of dung that’s oozing and dripping all over you down to your finger-tips?” “You’re the ones that are mad! You’re the ones that are crazy!

Then that one filled the dice with poison and then said: “Come on, let’s have a game!” The other agreed, they played again, and once again the one player, whenever [349] he got the unlucky dice, swallowed it.

[350] And there they saw a pile of hemp that had been thrown away, and one said: “Here’s some hemp. You make a bundle, I’ll make a bundle, and we’ll both carry it off.” The other agreed, and they did so. Then, coming to another village street, they found some hemp-thread, and one said: “This pile of hemp-thread is just what we wanted the hemp for. Let’s each throw away our bundle of hemp, and we’ll go on with a load of hemp-thread each.” “I’ve brought this bundle of hemp a long way and it’s well tied up.

[351] In another village they saw a pile of flax..., in another, linen-thread..., in another, linen-cloth..., in another, cotton..., in another, cotton-thread..., in another, cotton-cloth..., in another, iron..., in another, copper..., in another, tin..., in another, lead..., in another, silver..., in another, gold.

<div class="fmtx1">32. Then Prince Pāyāsi established a charity for ascetics and Brahmins, wayfarers, beggars and the needy.

<div class="fmtx1">And Prince Pāyāsi heard of his words, [355] so he sent for him and asked him if he had said that. ‘Yes, Lord.’ ‘But why did you say such a thing? Friend Uttara, don’t we who wish to gain merit expect a reward for our charity?’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘But, Lord, the food you give &mdash; broken rice with sour gruel &mdash; you would not care to touch it with your foot, much less eat it!

Lord, you are kind and gentle to us, so how can we reconcile such kindness and gentleness with unkindness and roughness?’ ‘Well then, Uttara, you arrange to supply food as I eat and clothes such as I wear.’ ‘Very good, Lord’, said Uttara, and he did so.<a id="calibre_link-1077" href="#calibre_link-22" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">730</sup></a> [356]</div>
<div class="fmtx1">And Prince Pāyāsi, because he had established his charity grudgingly, not with his own hands, and without proper concern, like something casually tossed aside, was reborn after his death, at the breaking-up of the body, in the company of the Four Great Kings, in the empty Serīsaka mansion. But Uttara, who had given the charity ungrudgingly, with his own hands and with proper concern, not as something tossed aside, was reborn after death, at the breaking-up of the body,  in a good place, a heavenly realm, in the company of the Thirty-Three Gods.</div>

And the venerable Gavampati said to him, as he stood there: ‘Who are you, friend?’ ‘Lord, I am Prince Pāyāsi.’ ‘Friend, are you not the one who used to say: “There is no other world, there are no spontaneously born beings, there is no fruit or result of good or evil deeds”?’ ‘Yes, Lord, I am the one who used to say that, but I [357] was converted from that evil view by the Noble Kumāra-Kassapa.’ ‘And where has the young Brahmin Uttara, who was in charge of the distribution of your charity, been reborn? ’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Lord, he who gave the charity ungrudgingly...was reborn in the company of the Thirty-Three Gods, but I, who gave grudgingly,... have been reborn here in the empty Serīsaka mansion.

<div class="fmtx1">34. And so the Venerable Gavampati, on his return to earth, declared: ‘You should give ungrudgingly, with your own hands, with proper concern, not carelessly. Prince Pāyāsi did not do this, and at death, at the breaking-up of the body, he was reborn in the company of the Four Great Kings in the empty Serīsaka mansion, whereas the administrator of his charity, the young Brahmin Uttara, who gave ungrudgingly, with his own hands, with proper concern and not carelessly, was reborn in the company of the Thirty-Three Gods.’</div>

<div class="fmtx">[1] 1.1 THUS HAVE I HEARD.<a id="calibre_link-1079" href="#calibre_link-2324" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">732</sup></a> Once the Lord was staying among the Mallas. Anupiya is the name of a Malla town, and the Lord, having dressed in the early morning and taken his robe and bowl, went to Anupiya for alms. Then he thought: ‘It is too early for me to go into Anupiya for alms. Suppose I were to visit the hermitage<a id="calibre_link-1080" href="#calibre_link-2325" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">733</sup></a> of the wanderer Bhaggava-gotta?’ And he did so. [2]</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.2. And the wanderer Bhaggava-gotta said: ‘Come, Blessed Lord, welcome, Blessed Lord! At last the Blessed Lord has gone out of his way to come here. Be seated, Lord, a seat is prepared.’ The Lord sat down on the prepared seat, and Bhaggava took a low stool and sat down to one side. Then he said: ‘Lord, a few days ago Sunakkhatta the Licchave<a id="calibre_link-1081" href="#calibre_link-2326" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">734</sup></a> came to me and said: “Bhaggava, I have left the Blessed Lord. I am no longer under his rule.” Is that really so, Lord?’ ‘It is true, Bhaggava.<a id="calibre_link-1082" href="#calibre_link-2327" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">735</sup></a></div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.3. ‘A few days ago, Sunakkhatta came to me, saluted me, sat down to one side, and said: “Lord, I am leaving the Blessed Lord, I am no longer under the Lord’s rule.” So I said to him: “Well, Sunakkhatta, did I ever say to you: ‘Come, Sunakkhatta, be under my rule’?” “No, Lord.” [3] “Or did you ever say to me: ‘Lord, I will be under your rule’?” “No, Lord.” “So, Sunakkhatta, if I did not say that to you and you did not say that to me &mdash; you foolish man, who are you and what are you giving up? Consider, foolish man, how far the fault is yours.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.4. “‘Well, Lord, you have not performed any miracles.”<a id="calibre_link-1083" href="#calibre_link-2328" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">736</sup></a>  “And did I ever say to you: ‘Come under my rule, Sunakkhatta, and I will perform miracles for you’?” “No, Lord.” “Or did  you ever say to me: ‘Lord, I will be under your rule if you will perform miracles for me’?” “No, Lord.” “Then it appears, Sunakkhatta, that I made no such promises, and you made no such conditions. Such being the case, you foolish man, who are you and what are you giving up?</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘“What do you think, Sunakkhatta? Whether miracles are performed or not &mdash; is it the purpose of my teaching Dhamma to lead whoever practises it<a id="calibre_link-1084" href="#calibre_link-2329" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">737</sup></a> to the total destruction of suffering?” [4] “It is, Lord.” “So, Sunakkhatta, whether miracles are performed or not, the purpose of my teaching Dhamma is to lead whoever practises it to the total destruction of suffering. Then what purpose would the performance of miracles serve? Consider, you foolish man, how far the fault is yours.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.5. “‘Well, Lord, you do not teach the beginning of things.” “And did I ever say to you: ‘Come under my rule, Sunakkhatta, and I will teach you the beginning of things’?” “No, Lord.” ... Such being the case, you foolish man, who are you and what are you giving up? [5]</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.6. ‘“Sunakkhatta, you have in many ways spoken in praise of me among the Vajjians, saying: ‘This Blessed Lord is an Arahant, a fully-enlightened Buddha, endowed with wisdom and conduct, the Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed, Teacher of gods and humans, the Buddha, the Blessed Lord.’ You have in many ways spoken in praise of the Dhamma, saying: ‘Well-proclaimed by the Blessed Lord is the Dhamma, visible here and now, timeless, inviting inspection, leading onward, to be realised by the wise, each one for himself.’ You have in many ways spoken in praise of the order of monks, saying: ‘Well-trained is the order of the Lord’s disciples, trained in uprightness, methodically-trained, excellently-trained is the order of the Lord’s disciples, that is, the four pairs of men, the eight classes of individuals. This is the order of the Lord’s disciples, worthy of respect, worthy of homage, worthy of gifts, worthy of salutation, an unsurpassed field in the world for merit.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘“In these ways you have spoken in praise of me, of the Dhamma, and of the order among the Vajjians. And I say to you, I declare to you, Sunakkhatta, there will be those who will say: ‘Sunakkhatta the Licchavi was unable to maintain  the holy life under the ascetic Gotama, and being thus unable he abandoned the training and reverted to a base life.’<a id="calibre_link-1085" href="#calibre_link-2330" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">738</sup></a> That, Sunakkhatta, is what they will say.” [6] And, Bhaggava, at my words Sunakkhatta left this Dhamma and discipline like one condemned to hell.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.7. ‘Once, Bhaggava, I was staying among the Khulus,<a id="calibre_link-1086" href="#calibre_link-2331" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">739</sup></a> at a place called Uttarakā, a town of theirs. In the early morning I went with robe and bowl into Uttarakā for alms, with Sunakkhatta as my attendant. And at that time the naked ascetic Korakkhattiya the “dog-man”<a id="calibre_link-1087" href="#calibre_link-2332" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">740</sup></a> was going round on all fours, sprawling on the ground, and chewing and eating his food with his mouth alone. Seeing him, Sunakkhatta thought: “Now that is a real Arahant ascetic, who goes round on all fours, sprawling on the ground, and chewing and eating his food with his mouth alone.” And I, knowing his thought in my own mind, said to him: “You foolish man, do you claim to be a follower of the Sakyan?” “Lord, what do you mean by this question?” [7] “Sunakkhatta, did you not, on seeing that naked ascetic going around on all fours, think: ‘Now that is a real Arahant ascetic, who goes round on all fours, sprawling on the ground, and chewing and eating his food with his mouth alone’?” “I did, Lord. Does the Blessed Lord begrudge others their Arahantship?” “I do not begrudge others their Arahantship, you foolish man! It is only in you that this evil view has arisen. Cast it aside lest it should be to your harm and sorrow for a long time! This naked ascetic Korakkhattiya, whom you regard as a true Arahant, will die in seven days from indigestion,  <a id="calibre_link-1088" href="#calibre_link-2333" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">741</sup></a> and when he is dead he will reappear among the Kālakañja asuras, who are the very lowest grade of asuras.<a id="calibre_link-1089" href="#calibre_link-2334" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">742</sup></a>  And when he is dead he will be cast aside on a heap of  <i class="calibre9">bῑraṇa-</i>grass in the charnel-ground. If you want to, Sunakkhatta, you can go to him and ask him if he knows his fate. And it may be that he will tell you: ‘Friend Sunakkhatta, I know my fate. I have been reborn among the Kālakañja asuras, the very lowest grade of asuras.’”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.8. ‘Then Sunakkhatta went to Korakkhattiya and told him what I had prophesied, [8] adding: “Therefore, friend Korakkhattiya, be very careful what you eat and drink, so that the ascetic Gotama’s words may be proved wrong!” And Sunakkhatta  was so sure that the Tathāgata’s words would be proved wrong that he counted up the seven days one by one. But on the seventh day Korakkhattiya died of indigestion, and when he was dead he reappeared among the Kālakañja asuras, and his body was cast aside on a heap of <i class="calibre9">bῑraṇa-</i>grass in the charnel-ground.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.9. ‘And Sunakkhatta heard of this, so he went to the heap of <i class="calibre9">bῑraṇa</i>-grass in the charnel-ground where Korakkhattiya was lying, struck the body three times with his hand, and said: “Friend Korakkhattiya, do you know your fate?” And Korakkhattiya sat up and rubbed his back with his hand, and said: “Friend Sunakkhatta, I know my fate. I have been reborn among the Kālakañja asuras, the very lowest grade of asuras.” And with that, he fell back again.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.10. ‘Then Sunakkhatta came to me, saluted me, and sat down to one side. And I said to him: “Well, Sunakkhatta, what do you think? Has what I told you about the ‘dog-man’ Korakkhattiya come true or not?” “It has come about the way you said, Lord, and not otherwise.” [9] “Well, what do you think, Sunakkhatta? Has a miracle been performed or not?” “Certainly, Lord, this being so, a miracle has been performed, and not otherwise.” “Well then, you foolish man, do you still say to me, after I have performed such a miracle: ‘Well, Lord, you have not performed any miracles’? Consider, you foolish man, how far the fault is yours.” And at my words Sunakkhatta left this Dhamma and discipline like one condemned to hell.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.11. ‘Once, Bhaggava, I was staying at Vesali, at the Gabled Hall in the Great Forest. And at that time there was a naked ascetic living in Vesālῑ called Kaḷāramuṭṭhaka<a id="calibre_link-1090" href="#calibre_link-2335" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">743</sup></a> who enjoyed great gains and fame in the Vajjian capital. He had undertaken seven rules of practice: “As long as I live I will be a naked ascetic and will not put on any clothes; as long as I live I will remain chaste and abstain from sexual intercourse; as long as I live I will subsist on strong drink and meat, abstaining from boiled rice and sour milk; as long as I live I will never go beyond the Udena shrine to the east of Vesāli, the Gotamaka shrine to the south, the Sattamba shrine [10] to the west, nor the Bahuputta shrine to the north.”<a id="calibre_link-1091" href="#calibre_link-2336" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">744</sup></a> And it was  through having undertaken these seven rules that he enjoyed the greatest gains and fame of all in the Vajjian capital.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.12. ‘Now Sunakkhatta went to see Kaḷāramuṭṭhaka and asked him a question which he could not answer, and because he could not answer it he showed signs of anger, rage and petulance. But Sunakkhatta thought: “I might cause this real Arahant ascetic offence. I don’t want anything to happen that would be to my lasting harm and misfortune!”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.13. ‘Then Sunakkhatta came to me, saluted me, and sat down to one side. I said to him: “You foolish man, do you claim to be a follower of the Sakyan?” “Lord, what do you mean by this question?” “Sunakkhatta, did you not go to see Kaḷāramuṭṭhaka and ask him a question he could not answer, and did he not thereupon show signs of anger, rage and petulance? And did you not think: ‘I might cause this real Arahant ascetic offence. I don’t want anything to happen that would be to my lasting harm and misfortune’?” “I did, Lord. Does the Blessed Lord begrudge others their Arahantship?” [11] “I do not begrudge others their Arahantship, you foolish man. It is only in you that this evil view has arisen. Cast it aside lest it should be to your harm and sorrow for a long time! This naked ascetic Kaḷāramuṭṭhaka, whom you regard as a true Arahant, will before long be living clothed and married, subsisting on boiled rice and sour milk. He will go beyond all the shrines of Vesālῑ, and will die having entirely lost his reputation.” And indeed all this came about.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.14. ‘Then Sunakkhatta, having heard what had happened, came to me...And I said: “Well, Sunakkhatta, what do you think? Has what I told you about Kaḷaramuṭṭhaka come about, or not? ... Has a miracle been performed or not?” ... [12] And at my words Sunakkhatta left this Dhamma and discipline like one condemned to hell.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.15. ‘Once, Bhaggava, I was staying at Vesali in the Gabled Hall in the Great Forest. And at that time there was a naked ascetic living in Vesālῑ called Patikaputta, who enjoyed great gains and fame in the Vajjian capital. And he made this declaration in the assembly of Vesālῑ: “The ascetic Gotama claims to be a man of wisdom, and I make the same claim. It is right that a man of wisdom should show it by performing  miracles. If the ascetic Gotama will come half-way to meet me, I will do likewise. Then we could both work miracles, and if the ascetic Gotama performs one miracle, I will perform two. If he performs two, I will perform [13] four. And if he performs four, I will perform eight. However many miracles the ascetic Gotama performs, I will perform twice as many!”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.16. ‘Then Sunakkhatta came to me, saluted me, sat down to one side, and told me what Patikaputta had said. I said: “Sunakkhatta, that naked ascetic Patikaputta is not capable of meeting me face to face unless he takes back his words, abandons that thought, and gives up that view. And if he thinks otherwise, his head will split in pieces.”<a id="calibre_link-1092" href="#calibre_link-2337" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">745</sup></a></div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.17. ‘“Lord, let the Blessed Lord have a care what he says, let the Well-Farer have a care what he says!” [41] “What do you mean by saying that to me?” “Lord, the Blessed Lord might make an absolute statement about Patikaputta’s coming. But he might come in some altered shape, and thus falsify the Blessed Lord’s words!”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.18. ‘“But, Sunakkhatta, would the Tathagata make any statement that was ambiguous?” “Lord, does the Blessed Lord know by his own mind what would happen to Patikaputta? Or has some deva told the Tathagata?” “Sunakkhatta, I know it by my own mind, and I have also been told by a deva. [15] For Ajita, the general of the Licchavis, died the other day and has been reborn in the company of the Thirty-Three Gods. He came to see me and told me: ‘Lord, Patikaputta the naked ascetic is an impudent liar! He declared in the Vajjian capital: “Ajita, the general of the Licchavis, has been reborn in the great hell!” But I have not been reborn in the great hell, but in the company of the Thirty-Three Gods. He is an impudent liar...’ Thus, Sunakkhatta, I know what I have said by my own mind, but I have also been told by a deva. And now, Sunakkhatta, I will go into Vesālῑ for alms. On my return, after I have eaten, I will go for my midday rest to Pāṭikaputta’s park. You may tell him whatever you wish.” [16]</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.19. ‘Then, having dressed, I took my robe and bowl and went into Vesālῑ for alms. On my return I went to Patikaputta’s park for my midday rest. Meanwhile Sunakkhatta rushed into Vesālῑ and declared to all the prominent Licchavis: “Friends,  the Blessed Lord has gone into Vesālῑ for alms, and after that he has gone for his midday rest to Pātṭkaputta’s park. Come along, friends, come along! the two great ascetics are going to work miracles!” And all the prominent Licchavis thought: “The two great ascetics are going to work miracles! Let us go along!” And he went to the distinguished and wealthy Brahmins and householders, and to the ascetics and Brahmins of various schools, and told them the same thing, and they too thought: “Let us go along!” [17] And so all these people came along to Paṭikaputta’s park, hundreds and thousands of them.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.20. ‘And Pāṭikaputta heard that all these people had come to his park, and that the ascetic Gotama had gone there for his midday rest. And at the news he was overcome with fear and trembling, and his hair stood on end. And thus terrified and trembling, his hair standing on end, he made for the Tinduka lodging of the wanderers.<a id="calibre_link-1093" href="#calibre_link-2338" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">746</sup></a> When the assembled company heard that he had gone to the Tinduka lodging, they instructed a man to go there to Pāṭikaputta and say to him: “Friend Pāṭikaputta, come along! All these people have come to your park, and the ascetic Gotama has gone there for his midday rest. Because you declared to the assembly at Vesālῑ: ‘The ascetic Gotama claims to be a man of wisdom, and I make the same claim ... (as verse 15). [18] However many miracles he performs, I will perform twice as many!’ So now come half-way: the ascetic Gotama has already come half-way to meet you, and is sitting for his midday rest in Your Reverence’s park.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.21. ‘The man went and delivered the message, and on hearing it Pāṭikaputta said: “I’m coming, friend, [19] coming!” but, wriggle as he might, he could not get up from his seat. Then the man said: “What’s the matter with you, friend Pāṭikaputta? Is your bottom stuck to the seat, or is the seat stuck to your bottom? You keep saying: ‘I’m coming, friend, I’m coming!’, but you only wriggle and can’t get up from your seat.” And even at these words, Pāṭikaputta still wriggled about, but could not rise.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.22. ‘And when that man realised that Pāṭikaputta could not help himself, he went back to the assembly and reported the situation. And then I said to them: “Pāṭikaputta the naked  ascetic is not capable of meeting me face to face unless he takes back his words, abandons that thought, and gives up that view.

All these people have come to your park and the ascetic Gotama has gone there for his midday rest. If you come, we will make you the winner and let the ascetic Gotama be defeated.”</div>

Then I could emerge in the evening, yawn, survey the four quarters, roar  my lion’s roar three times, and then make for the cattle-pasture.

Suppose I were to make my lair near the jungle...’ So he chose a lair accordingly and emerging in the evening, he surveyed the four quarters, and then thought: ‘Now I will roar a lion’s roar three times’, - and he gave out the howl of his kind, a jackal howl.

<div class="fmtx1">2.14. ‘Bhaggava, I know the first beginning of things,<a id="calibre_link-1098" href="#calibre_link-2343" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">751</sup></a> and I know not only that, but what surpasses it in value.<a id="calibre_link-1099" href="#calibre_link-2344" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">752</sup></a> And I am not under the sway of what I know, and not being under its sway I have come to know for myself that quenching,<a id="calibre_link-1100" href="#calibre_link-2345" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">753</sup></a> by the realisation of which the Tathagata cannot fall into perilous paths.<a id="calibre_link-1101" href="#calibre_link-2346" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">754</sup></a> There are, Bhaggava, some ascetics and Brahmins who declare as their doctrine that all things began with the creation by a god,<a id="calibre_link-1102" href="#calibre_link-2347" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">755</sup></a> or Brahma. I have gone to them and said: “Reverend sirs, is it true that you declare that all things began with the creation by a god, or Brahma?” “Yes”, they replied. Then I asked: “In that case, how do the reverend teachers declare that this came about?” But they could not give an answer, and so they asked me in return. And I replied:</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.15.-17. ‘“There comes a time, friends, sooner or later after a long period, when this world contracts... <i class="calibre9">Beings are born in the Abhassara Brahma world and stay there a long time. When this world expands, one being falls from there and arises in an empty Brahma palace. He longs for company, other beings appear, and he and they believe he created them (Sutta 1, verses</i> 2.2-6). [29-30] That, Reverend Sirs, is how it comes about that you teach that all things began with the creation by a god, or Brahma.” And they said: “We have heard this, Reverend Gotama, as you have explained.” But I know the first beginning of things... and not being under the sway of what I know I have come to know that quenching by the realisation of which the Tathāgata cannot fall into perilous ways.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.18. ‘There are some ascetics and Brahmins who declare that the beginning of things was due to corruption by pleasure. I went to them and asked them if this was their view. “Yes”, they replied. [31] I asked them how this came about, and when they could not explain, I said: “There are, friends, certain devas called Corrupted by Pleasure. They spend an excessive amount of time addicted to merriment... <i class="calibre9">their mindfulness lapses, and they fall away (Sutta 1, verses 2.</i>7 &mdash; 9). That, [32] Reverend Sirs, is how it comes about that you teach that the beginning of things was due to corruption by pleasure.” And  they said: “We have heard this, Reverend Gotama, as you have explained.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.19. ‘There are some ascetics and Brahmins who declare that the beginning of things was due to corruption of mind. I went to them and asked them if this was their view. “Yes”, they replied.

They spend an excessive amount of time regarding each other with envy... <i class="calibre9">their minds become corrupted, and they fall away (Sutta 1, verses 2.10 &mdash; 13)</i>. [33] That, Reverend Sirs, is how it comes about that you teach that the beginning of things was due to corruption of mind.” And they said: “We have heard this, Reverend Gotama, as you have explained.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.20. ‘There are, Bhaggava, some ascetics and Brahmins who declare that the beginning of things was due to chance. I went to them and asked them if this was their view. “Yes”, they replied. I asked them how this came about, and when they could not explain, I said: “There are, friends, certain devas called Unconscious. As soon as a perception arises in them, those devas fall from that realm ... <i class="calibre9">remembering nothing (Sutta</i>,  <i class="calibre9">1</i>, <i class="calibre9">verse 2.31</i>) they think: ‘Now from non-being I have been brought to being.’ [34] That, Reverend Sirs, is how it comes about that you teach that the beginning of things was due to chance.” And they said: “We have heard this, Reverend Gotama, as you have explained.” But I know the first beginning of things, and I know not only that, but what surpasses it in value. And I am not under the sway of what I know, and not being under its sway I have come to know for myself that quenching, by the realisation of which the Tathāgata cannot fall into perilous paths.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2.21. ‘And I, Bhaggava, who teach this and declare this am wrongly, vainly, lyingly and falsely accused by some ascetics and Brahmins who say: “The ascetic Gotama is on the wrong track,<a id="calibre_link-1103" href="#calibre_link-2348" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">756</sup></a> and so are his monks.

<div class="fmtx1">‘Indeed, Lord, they are on the wrong track themselves who accuse the Lord and his monks of error. I am so delighted with the Lord [35] that I think the Lord is able to teach me to attain and remain in the deliverance called “the Beautiful”.’</div>

<div class="fmhT"><b class="calibre13">25 <i class="calibre8">Udumbarika-Sῑhanāda Sutta: The Great Lion’s Roar to the Udumbarikans</i></b></div>
<div class="fmtx">[36] 1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. Once the Lord was staying in Rājagaha at the Vultures’ Peak. And at that time the wanderer Nigrodha<a id="calibre_link-1106" href="#calibre_link-2179" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">759</sup></a> was staying at the Udumbarikā lodging<a id="calibre_link-1107" href="#calibre_link-2180" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">760</sup></a> for wanderers, with a large company of some three thousand wanderers. And one morning early, the householder Sandhana came to Rājagaha in order to see the Lord. Then he thought: ‘It is not the proper time to see the Blessed Lord, he is in retreat; it is not the proper time to see the meditating monks, they are in retreat. Perhaps I should go to the Udumbarikā lodging for wanderers and call on Nigrodha.’ And he did so.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2. And just then Nigrodha was sitting in the midst of a large crowd of wanderers who were all shouting and screaming and making a great clamour, and indulging in various kinds of unedifying conversation<a id="calibre_link-1108" href="#calibre_link-2181" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">761</sup></a> about kings, [37] robbers, ministers, armies, dangers, war, food, drink, clothes, beds, garlands, perfumes, relatives, carriages, villages, towns and cities, countries, women, heroes, street- and well-gossip, talk of the departed, desultory chat, speculation about land and sea, talk of being and non-being.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">3. Then Nigrodha saw Sandhāna approaching from a distance, and he called his followers to order, saying: ‘Be quiet, gentlemen, don’t make a noise, gentlemen! The householder Sandhāna, a follower of the ascetic Gotama, is approaching. He is one of the number of white-robed householder followers of the ascetic Gotama in Rājagaha. And these good folk are fond of quiet, they are taught to be quiet and speak in praise of quiet. If he sees that this company is quiet, he will most likely want to come and visit us.’ At this the wanderers fell silent.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">4. Then Sandhāna approached Nigrodha and exchanged  courtesies with him, and then sat down to one side. Then he said: ‘Reverend sirs, the way the wanderers of another faith conduct themselves when they come together is one thing: [38] they make a great clamour and indulge in all manner of unedifying conversation...The Blessed Lord’s way is different : he seeks a lodging in the forest, in the depths of the jungle, free from noise, with little sound, far from the madding crowd, undisturbed by men, well fitted for seclusion.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">5. Then Nigrodha replied: ‘Well now, householder, do you know whom the ascetic Gotama talks to? Whom does he converse with? From whom does he get his lucidity of wisdom? The ascetic Gotama’s wisdom is destroyed by the solitary life, he is unused to assemblies, he is no good at conversation, he is right out of touch. Just as bison<a id="calibre_link-1109" href="#calibre_link-2182" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">762</sup></a> circling around keep to the fringes, so it is with the ascetic Gotama. In fact, householder, if the ascetic Gotama were to come to this assembly, we would baffle him with a single question, we would knock him over like an empty pot.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">6. Now the Lord, with his divine-ear-faculty, purified and surpassing human range, heard this exchange between Sandhāna and Nigrodha. And, descending from the Vultures’ Peak, he came to the Peacocks’ Feeding Ground beside the Sumāgadha Tank, and [39] walked up and down there in the open air. Then Nigrodha caught sight of him, and he called his company to order, saying: ‘Gentlemen, he quiet, be less noisy! The ascetic Gotama is walking up and down beside the Sumāgadha Tank. He is fond of quiet, he speaks in praise of quiet. If he sees that this company is quiet, he will most likely want to come and visit us. If he does so, we will put this question to him: “Lord, what is this doctrine in which the Blessed Lord trains his disciples, and which those disciples whom he has so trained as to benefit from it recognise as their principal support, and the perfection of the holy life?”’ At this, the wanderers were silent.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">7. Then the Lord approached Nigrodha, and Nigrodha said: ‘Come, Blessed Lord, welcome, Blessed Lord! At last the Blessed Lord has gone out of his way to come here. Be seated, Lord, a seat is prepared.’ The Lord sat down on the prepared seat, and Nigrodha took a low stool and sat down to one side. Then  the Lord said to him: ‘Nigrodha, what was the subject of your conversation just now? What talk have I interrupted?’ Nigrodha replied: ‘Lord, we saw the Blessed Lord walking up and down at the Peacocks’ Feeding Ground by the Sumāgadhā Tank, [40] and we thought: “If the ascetic Gotama were to come here we could ask him this question: Lord, what is this doctrine in which the Blessed Lord trains his disciples, and which those disciples whom he has so trained as to benefit from it recognise as their principal support, and the perfection of the holy life?”’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Nigrodha, it is hard for you, holding different views, being of different inclinations and subject to different influences, following a different teacher, to understand the doctrine which I teach my disciples... Come on then, Nigrodha, ask me about your own teaching, about your extreme austerity. How are the conditions of austerity and self-mortification fulfilled, and how are they not fulfilled?’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">At this the wanderers made a great commotion and noise, exclaiming: ‘It is wonderful, it is marvellous how great are the powers of the ascetic Gotama in holding back with his own theories and in inviting others to discuss theirs!’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">8. Silencing them, Nigrodha said: ‘Lord, we teach the higher austerities, we regard them as essential, we adhere to them. Such being the case, what constitutes their fulfilment or non-fulfilment? ’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Suppose, Nigrodha, a self-mortifier goes naked, uses no polite restraints, licks his hands, does not come or stand still when requested. [41] He does not accept food out of the pot or pan...(<i class="calibre9">as Sutta 8, verse 14).</i> He wears coarse hemp or mixed material, shrouds from corpses, rags from the dust-heap ... He is a plucker-out of hair and beard, devoted [42] to this practice; he is a covered-thorn man, making his bed on them, sleeping alone in a garment of wet mud, living in the open air, accepting whatever seat is offered, one who drinks no water and is addicted to the practice, or he dwells intent on the practice of going to bathe three times before evening. What do you think, Nigrodha, is the higher austerity thereby fulfilled, or not?’ ‘Indeed, Lord, it is fulfilled.’ ‘But, Nigrodha, I maintain that this higher austerity can be faulted in various ways.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">9. ‘In what way, Lord, do you maintain that it can be faulted ?’ ‘Take the case, Nigrodha, of a self-mortifier who practises a certain austerity. As a result, he is pleased and satisfied at having attained his end. And this is a fault in that self-mortifier. Or else in so doing he elevates himself and disparages others. And this is a fault in that self-mortifier. Or else he has become intoxicated with conceit, infatuated and therefore careless. And this [43] is a fault in that self-mortifier.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">10. ‘Again, a self-mortifier practises a certain austerity, and this brings him gains, honours and fame. As a result, he is pleased and satisfied at having attained his end... Or else he elevates himself and disparages others ... Or else he becomes intoxicated with conceit, infatuated and therefore careless. And this is a fault in that self-mortifier. Again, a self-mortifier practises a certain austerity, and he divides his food into two heaps, saying: “This suits me, that doesn’t suit me!” And what does not suit him he eagerly rejects, while what suits him he eats up greedily, recklessly and passionately, not seeing the peril, with no thought for the consequences. And this is a fault in that self-mortifier. [44] Again, a self-mortifier practises a certain austerity for the sake of gains, honours and fame, thinking: “Kings and their ministers will honour me, Khattiyas and Brahmins and householders, and religious teachers.” And this is a fault in that self-mortifier.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">11. ‘Again, a self-mortifier disparages some ascetic or Brahmin, saying: “See how he lives in abundance, eating all sorts of things! Whether propagated from roots, from stems, from joings, from cuttings or fifthly from seeds,<a id="calibre_link-1110" href="#calibre_link-2183" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">763</sup></a> he chews them all up with that thunderbolt of a jaw of his, and they call him an ascetic!” And this is a fault in that self-mortifier. Or he sees another ascetic or Brahmin being made much of by families, being honoured and respected and worshipped, and he thinks: “They make much of that rich-liver, they honour him, respect him and worship him, whereas I who am a real ascetic and self-mortifier get no such treatment!” Thus he is envious and jealous because of those householders. And this is a fault in that self-mortifier.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Again, a self-mortifier sits in a prominent position. And this is a fault in that self-mortifier. Or he goes round ostentatiously  <a id="calibre_link-1111" href="#calibre_link-2184" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">764</sup></a> among the families, as if to say: “See, this is my way of renunciation!” And this is a fault in that self-mortifier. [45] Or he behaves in an underhand way. On being asked: “Do you approve of this?” although he does not approve he says: “I do”, or although he does approve he says: “I do not.” In this way he becomes a conscious liar. And this is a fault in that self-mortifier.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">12. ‘Again, a self-mortifier, when the Tathagata or a disciple of the Tathagata presents the Dhamma in a way that should command his assent, withholds that assent. And this is a fault in that self-mortifier. Or he is angry and bad-tempered. And this is a fault in that self-mortifier. Or he is mean and spiteful, envious and jealous, crafty and deceitful, obstinate and proud, with evil desires and under their sway, with wrong views and given to extremist opinions; he is tainted with worldliness, holding on firmly, unwilling to give up. And this is a fault in that self-mortifier. What do you think, Nigrodha? Are these things faults in the higher austerity, or not?’ ‘Certainly they are, Lord. It could happen that a single self-mortifier was possessed of all these faults, not to speak of just one or the other.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">13.-14. ‘Now, Nigrodha, take the case of a certain self-mortifier who practises a certain austerity. As a result, he is not pleased and satisfied at having attained his end. This being so, [46] in this respect he is purified. Again, he does not elevate himself and disparage others... (<i class="calibre9">similarly with all examples in 10 &mdash; 11</i>). [47] Thus he does not become a conscious liar. In this respect he is purified.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">15. ‘Again, a self-mortifier, when the Tathagata or a disciple of the Tathagata presents the Dhamma in a way that should command his assent, gives his assent. In this respect he is purified. And he is not angry or bad-tempered. In this respect he is purified. And he is not mean and spiteful, envious and jealous, crafty and deceitful, obstinate and [48] proud, he is without evil desires and not under their sway, without wrong views and not given to extremist opinions, he is not tainted with worldliness, does not hold on firmly and is not unwilling to give up. In this respect he is purified. What do you think, Nigrodha? Is the higher austerity purified by these things, or  not?’ ‘Certainly it is, Lord, it attains its peak there, penetrating to the pith.’ ‘No, Nigrodha, it does not attain its peak there, penetrating to the pith. It has only reached the outer bark.’<a id="calibre_link-1112" href="#calibre_link-2185" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">765</sup></a></div>
<div class="fmtx1">16. ‘Well then, Lord, how does austerity attain its peak, penetrating to the pith? It would be good if the Blessed Lord were to cause my austerity to attain its peak, to penetrate to the pith.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Nigrodha, take the case of a self-mortifier who observes the fourfold restraint. And what is this? Here, a self-mortifier does not harm a living being, does not cause a living being to be harmed, does not approve of such harming; [49] he does not take what is not given, or cause it to be taken, or approve of such taking; he does not tell a lie, or cause a lie to be told, or approve of such lying; he does not crave for sense-pleasures,<a id="calibre_link-1113" href="#calibre_link-2186" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">766</sup></a>  cause others to do so, or approve of such craving. In this way, a self-mortifier observes the fourfold restraint. And through this restraint, through making this his austerity, he takes an upward course and does not fall back into lower things.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Then he finds a solitary lodging, at the root of a forest tree, in a mountain cave or gorge, a charnel-ground, a jungle-thicket, or in the open air on a heap of straw. Then, having eaten after his return from the alms-round, he sits down cross-legged, holding his body erect, having established mindfulness before him.<a id="calibre_link-1114" href="#calibre_link-2187" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">767</sup></a> Abandoning hankering for the world, he dwells with a mind freed from such hankering, and his mind is purified of it. Abandoning ill-will and hatred, he dwells with a mind freed from them, and by compassionate love for the welfare of all living beings, his mind is purified of them. Abandoning sloth-and-torpor, ... by the perception of light,<a id="calibre_link-1115" href="#calibre_link-2188" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">768</sup></a> mindful and clearly aware, his mind is purified of sloth-and-torpor. Abandoning worry-and-flurry, ... and with an inwardly calmed heart his mind<a id="calibre_link-1116" href="#calibre_link-2189" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">769</sup></a> is purified of worry-and-flurry. Abandoning doubt, he dwells with doubt left behind, without uncertainty as to what things are wholesome, his mind purified of doubt.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">17. ‘Having abandoned these five hindrances, and in order to weaken by insight the defilements<a id="calibre_link-1117" href="#calibre_link-2190" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">770</sup></a> of mind, he dwells, letting his mind, filled with loving-kindness, pervade one quarter, then a second, then a third, then a fourth. And so he continues to pervade the whole wide world, above, below,  across and everywhere with a mind filled with loving-kindness, extensive, [50] developed,<a id="calibre_link-1118" href="#calibre_link-2191" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">771</sup></a> measureless, free from hatred and ill-will. And he dwells, letting his mind, filled with compassion, ... with sympathetic joy, ... with equanimity, pervade one quarter,... extensive, developed, measureless, free from hatred and ill-will. What do you think, Nigrodha? Is the higher austerity purified by these things, or not?’ ‘Certainly it is, Lord. It attains its peak there, penetrating to the pith.’ ‘No, Nigrodha, it does not attain its peak there. It has only penetrated to the inner bark.<a id="calibre_link-1119" href="#calibre_link-2192" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">772</sup></a></div>
<div class="fmtx1">18. ‘Well then, Lord, how does austerity attain its peak, penetrating to the pith? It would be good if the Blessed Lord were to cause my austerity to attain its peak, to penetrate to the pith.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Nigrodha, take the case of a self-mortifier who observes the fourfold restraint... (<i class="calibre9">as verses 16-17</i>), free from hatred and ill-will. He recalls various past lives ... There my name was so-and-so,... my caste was so-and-so...(<i class="calibre9">as Sutta 1</i>, <i class="calibre9">verse 1.31</i>). I experienced such-and-such pleasant and painful conditions ...Having passed from there, I arose there... [51] Thus he remembers various past lives, their conditions and details. What do you think, Nigrodha? Is the higher austerity purified by these things, or not?’ ‘Certainly it is, Lord. It attains its peak there, penetrating to the pith.’ ‘No, Nigrodha, it only reaches the fibres surrounding the pith.’<a id="calibre_link-1120" href="#calibre_link-2193" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">773</sup></a></div>
<div class="fmtx1">19. ‘Well then, Lord, how does austerity reach its peak, penetrating to the pith? It would be good if the Blessed Lord were to cause my austerity to attain its peak, to penetrate to the pith.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Well, Nigrodha, take the case of a self-mortifier who observes the fourfold restraint..., free from hatred and ill-will... Thus he [52] remembers various past lives, their conditions and details. And then, with the purified divine eye, he sees beings passing away and arising: base and noble, well favoured and ill-favoured, to happy and unhappy destinations as kamma directs them. What do you think, Nigrodha? Is the higher austerity purified by these things, or not?’ ‘Certainly it is, Lord. It attains its peak there, penetrating to the pith.’<a id="calibre_link-1121" href="#calibre_link-2194" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">774</sup></a></div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘So indeed it is, Nigrodha, that austerity is so purified as to  reach its peak and penetrate to the pith. And so, Nigrodha, when you ask: “What, Lord, is this doctrine in which the Blessed Lord trains his disciples, and which those disciples whom he has so trained as to benefit from it recognise as their principal support, and the perfection of the holy life?” I say that it is by something more far-reaching and excellent that I train them, through which they...recognise as their principal support, and the perfection of the holy life.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">At this the wanderers made a great commotion and noise, exclaiming: ‘We and our teacher are ruined! We know of nothing higher or more far-reaching than our teaching!’ [53]</div>
<div class="fmtx1">20. And when the householder Sandhāna realised: ‘These wanderers of other views are actually listening and attending to the Lord’s words, and inclining their minds to the higher wisdom, he said to Nigrodha: ‘Reverend Nigrodha, you said to me: “Come now, householder, do you know whom the ascetic Gotama talks to? ... His wisdom is destroyed by the solitary life, he is no good at conversation, he is right out of touch...” So now that the Blessed Lord has come here, why don’t you baffle him with a single question and knock him over like an empty pot?’ And at these words Nigrodha was silent and upset, his shoulders drooped, he hung his head and sat there downcast and bewildered.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">21. Seeing the state he was in, the Lord said: ‘Is it true, Nigrodha, that you said that?’ [54] ‘Lord, it is true that I said that, foolishly, mistakenly, and wickedly.’ ‘What do you think, Nigrodha? Have you ever heard it said by wanderers who were aged, venerable, the teachers of teachers, that those who in the past were Arahants, fully-enlightened Buddhas used to talk, when they came together, by shouting and screaming and making a great clamour, and indulging in unedifying conversation ... the way you and your teachers do? Or did they not say rather that those Blessed Ones sought lodging in the forest, in the depths of the jungle, free from noise, with little sound, far from the madding crowd, undisturbed by men, well-fitted for seclusion, just as I do now?’ ‘Lord, I have heard it said that those who were Arahants, fully-enlightened Buddhas did not indulge in loud talk ... but sought lodging in the forest, ... just as the Blessed Lord does now.’ </div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Nigrodha, you are an intelligent man of mature years. Did it never occur to you to think: “The Blessed Lord is enlightened and teaches a doctrine of enlightenment, he is self-restrained and teaches a doctrine of self-restraint, he is calm and teaches a doctrine of calm. He has gone beyond [55] and teaches a doctrine of going beyond, he has gained Nibbāna and teaches a doctrine for the gaining of Nibbāna”?’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">22. At this, Nigrodha said to the Lord: ‘Transgression overcame me, Lord! Foolish, blind and evil as I was, that I spoke thus of the Lord. May the Lord accept my confession of this fault, that I may restrain myself in future!’<a id="calibre_link-1122" href="#calibre_link-2195" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">775</sup></a> ‘Indeed, Nigrodha, transgression overcame you when, through folly, blindness and evil you spoke thus of me. But since you recognise the nature of your transgression and make amends as is right, we accept your confession. For, Nigrodha, it is a mark of progress in the discipline of the Noble Ones, if anyone recognises the nature of his transgression and makes amends as is right, restraining himself for the future.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘But, Nigrodha, I tell you this: Let an intelligent man come to me who is sincere, honest and straightforward, and I will instruct him, I will teach him Dhamma. If he practises what he is taught, then within seven years he will attain in this life to that unequalled holy life and goal, for the sake of which young men of good family go forth from the household life into homelessness, by his own knowledge and realisation, and he will abide therein.

These are: the Wheel Treasure, the Elephant Treasure, the Horse Treasure, the Jewel Treasure, the Woman Treasure, the Householder Treasurer, and, as seventh, the Counsellor Treasure. He has more than a thousand sons who are heroes, of heroic stature, conquerors of the hostile army. He dwells having conquered  this sea-girt land without stick or sword, by the law (<i class="calibre9">as Sutta 3, verse 1.5</i>).</div>
<div class="fmtx1">3. ‘And, after many hundreds and thousands of years, King Daḷhanemi said to a certain man: “My good man, whenever you see that the sacred Wheel-Treasure has slipped from its position, report it to me.” “Yes, sire”, the man replied. And after many hundreds and thousands of years the man saw that the sacred Wheel-Treasure had slipped from its position. Seeing this, he reported the fact to the King. Then King Daḷhanemi sent for his eldest son, the crown prince, and said: “My son, the sacred Wheel-Treasure has slipped from its position. And I have heard say that when this happens to a wheel-turning monarch, he has not much longer to live. I have had my fill [60] of human pleasures, now is the time to seek heavenly pleasures. You, my son, take over control of this ocean-bounded land. I will shave off my hair and beard, don yellow robes, and go forth from the household life into homelessness.” And, having installed his eldest son in due form as king, King Daḷhanemi shaved off his hair and beard, donned yellow robes, and went forth from the household life into homelessness.

And in whatever country the Wheel stopped, the King took up residence with his fourfold army. And those who opposed him in the eastern region came and said: “Come, Your Majesty, welcome! We are yours, Your Majesty. Rule us, Your Majesty.” And the King said: “Do not take life.  Do not take what is not given. Do not commit sexual misconduct. Do not tell lies. Do not drink strong drink.

But he did not go to the royal sage and ask him about the duties of a wheel-turning monarch. Instead, he ruled the people according to his own ideas, and, being so ruled, the people did not prosper so well as they had done under the previous kings who had performed the duties of a wheel-turning monarch. Then the ministers, counsellors, treasury officials, guards and doorkeepers, and the chanters of mantras came to the King and said: [65] “Sire, as long as you rule the people according to your own ideas, and differently from the way they were ruled before under previous wheel-turning monarchs, the people do not prosper so well. Sire, there are ministers ... in your realm, including ourselves, who have preserved the knowledge of how a wheel-turning monarch should rule. Ask us, Your Majesty, and we will tell you!”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">10. ‘Then the King ordered all the ministers and others to come together, and he consulted them. And they explained to him the duties of a wheel-turning monarch. And, having listened to them, the King established guard and protection, but he did not give property to the needy, and as a result poverty became rife. With the spread of poverty, a man took what was not given, thus committing what was called theft. They arrested him, and brought him before the King, saying:  “Your Majesty, this man took what was not given, which we call theft.” The King said to him: “Is it true that you took what was not given &mdash; which is called theft?” “It is, Your Majesty.” “Why?” “Your Majesty, I have nothing to live on.” [66] Then the King gave the man some property, saying: “With this, my good man, you can keep yourself, support your mother and father, keep a wife and children, carry on a business and make gifts to ascetics and Brahmins, which will promote your spiritual welfare and lead to a happy rebirth with pleasant result in the heavenly sphere.” “Very good, Your Majesty”, replied the man.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">11. ‘And exactly the same thing happened with another man.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">12. ‘Then people heard that the King was giving away property to those who took what was not given, and they thought: “Suppose we were to do likewise!” And then another man took what was not given, and they brought him before the King. [67] The King asked him why he had done this, and he replied: “Your Majesty, I have nothing to live on.” Then the King thought: “If I give property to everybody who takes what is not given, this theft will increase more and more. I had better make an end of him, finish him off once for all, and cut his head off.” So he commanded his men: “Bind this man’s arms tightly behind him with a strong rope, shave his head closely, and lead him to the rough sound of a drum through the streets and squares and out through the southern gate, and there finish by inflicting the capital penalty and cutting off his head!” And they did so.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">13. ‘Hearing about this, people thought: “Now let us get sharp swords made for us, and then we can take from anybody what is not given [which is called theft], [68] we will make an end of them, finish them off once for all and cut off their heads.” So, having procured some sharp swords, they launched murderous assaults on villages, towns and cities, and went in for highway-robbery, killing their victims by cutting off their heads.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">14. ‘Thus, from the not giving of property to the needy, poverty became rife, from the growth of poverty, the taking of what was not given increased, from the increase of theft, the  use of weapons increased, from the increased use of weapons, the taking of life increased &mdash; and from the increase in the taking of life, people’s life-span decreased, their beauty decreased, and as a result of this decrease of life-span and beauty, the children of those whose life-span had been eighty thousand years lived for only forty thousand.</div>

<div class="fmhT"><b class="calibre13">27 <i class="calibre8">Aggañña Sutta: On Knowledge of Beginnings</i></b></div>
<div class="fmtx">[80] 1. THUS HAVE I HEARD.<a id="calibre_link-1157" href="#calibre_link-2023" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">810</sup></a> Once the Lord was staying at Savatthi, at the mansion of Migara’s mother<a id="calibre_link-1158" href="#calibre_link-2024" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">811</sup></a> in the East Park. And at that time Vasettha and Bhāradvāja<a id="calibre_link-1159" href="#calibre_link-2025" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">812</sup></a> were living among the monks, hoping to become monks themselves. And in the evening, the Lord rose from his secluded meditation and came out of the mansion, and started walking up and down in its shade.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2. Vasettha noticed this, and he said to Bhāradvāja: ‘Friend Bharadvaja, the Lord has come out and is walking up and down. Let us approach him. We might be fortunate enough to hear a talk on Dhamma from the Lord himself.’ ‘Yes, indeed’, said Bharadvaja, so they went up to the Lord, saluted him, and fell into step with him.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">3. Then the Lord said to Vasettha: [81] ‘Vāseṭṭha,<a id="calibre_link-1160" href="#calibre_link-2026" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">813</sup></a> you two are Brahmins born and bred, and you have gone forth from the household life into homelessness from Brahmin families. Do not the Brahmins revile and abuse you?’ ‘Indeed, Lord, the Brahmins do revile and abuse us. They don’t hold back with their usual flood of reproaches.’ ‘Well, Vasettha, what kind of reproaches do they fling at you?’ ‘Lord, what the Brahmins say is this: “The Brahmin caste<a id="calibre_link-1161" href="#calibre_link-2027" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">814</sup></a> is the highest caste, other castes are base; the Brahmin caste is fair, other castes are dark; Brahmins are purified, non-Brahmins are not, the Brahmins are the true children of Brahmā,<a id="calibre_link-1162" href="#calibre_link-2028" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">815</sup></a> born from his mouth, born of Brahma, created by Brahma, heirs of Brahma. And you, you have deserted the highest class and gone over to the base class of shaveling petty ascetics, servants, dark fellows born of Brahmā’s foot!<a id="calibre_link-1163" href="#calibre_link-2029" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">816</sup></a> It’s not right, it’s not proper for you to mix with such people!” That is the way the Brahmins abuse us, Lord.’ </div>
<div class="fmtx1">4. ‘Then, Vasettha, the Brahmins have forgotten their ancient tradition when they say that. Because we can see Brahmin women, the wives of Brahmins, who menstruate and become pregnant, [82] have babies and give suck. And yet these womb-born Brahmins talk about being born from Brahma’s mouth ... These Brahmins misrepresent Brahma, tell lies and earn much demerit.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">5. ‘There are, Vasettha, these four castes: the Khattiyas, the Brahmins, the merchants and the artisans.<a id="calibre_link-1164" href="#calibre_link-2030" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">817</sup></a> And sometimes a Khattiya takes life, takes what is not given, commits sexual misconduct, tells lies, indulges in slander, harsh speech or idle chatter, is grasping, malicious, or of wrong views. Thus such things as are immoral and considered so, blameworthy and considered so, to be avoided and considered so, ways unbefitting an Ariyan and considered so, black with black result<a id="calibre_link-1165" href="#calibre_link-2031" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">818</sup></a>  and blamed by the wise, are sometimes to be found among the Khattiyas, and the same applies to Brahmins, merchants and artisans.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">6. ‘Sometimes, too, a Khattiya refrains from taking life,... is not grasping, malicious, or of wrong views. Thus such things as are moral and considered so, blameless and considered so, to be followed and considered so, ways befitting an Ariyan and considered so, bright with bright results and praised by the wise, are sometimes to be found among the Khattiyas, and [83] likewise among Brahmins, merchants and artisans.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">7. ‘Now since both dark and bright qualities, which are blamed and praised by the wise, are scattered indiscriminately among the four castes, the wise do not recognise the claim about the Brahmin caste being the highest. Why is that? Because, Vasettha, anyone from the four castes who becomes a monk, an Arahant who has destroyed the corruptions, who has lived the life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden,<a id="calibre_link-1166" href="#calibre_link-2032" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">819</sup></a> reached the highest goal, destroyed the fetter of becoming, and become emancipated through super-knowledge &mdash; he is proclaimed supreme by virtue of Dhamma and not of non-Dhamma.</div>
<div class="atx"><div class="fmtx2">Dhamma’s the best thing for people <br class="calibre6" />In this life and the next as well.</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx1">8. ‘This illustration will make clear to you how Dhamma is best in this world and in the next. King Pasenadi of Kosala knows: “The ascetic Gotama has gone forth from the neighbouring clan of the Sakyans.” Now the Sakyans are vassals of the King of Kosala. They offer him humble service and salute him, rise and do him homage and pay him fitting service. And, just as the Sakyans offer the King humble service..., [84] so likewise does the King offer humble service to the Tathāgata,  <a id="calibre_link-1167" href="#calibre_link-2033" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">820</sup></a> thinking: “If the ascetic Gotama is well-born, I am ill-born; if the ascetic Gotama is strong, I am weak; if the ascetic Gotama is pleasant to look at, I am ill-favoured; if the ascetic Gotama is influential, I am of little influence.” Now it is because of honouring the Dhamma, making much of the Dhamma, esteeming the Dhamma, doing reverent homage to the Dhamma that King Pasenadi does humble service to the Tathagata and pays him fitting service:<div class="afmtx"><div class="fmtx2">Dhamma’s the best thing for people <br class="calibre6" />In this life and the next as well.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx1">9. ‘Vasettha, all of you, though of different birth, name, clan and family, who have gone forth from the household life into homelessness, if you are asked who you are, should reply: “We are ascetics, followers of the Sakyan.”<a id="calibre_link-1168" href="#calibre_link-2034" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">821</sup></a> He whose faith in the Tathagata is settled, rooted, established, solid, unshakeable by any ascetic or Brahmin, any deva or mara or Brahma or anyone in the world, can truly say: “I am a true son of Blessed Lord, born of his mouth, born of Dhamma, created by Dhamma, an heir of Dhamma.” Why is that? Because, Vasettha, this designates the Tathagata: “The Body of Dhamma”,<a id="calibre_link-1169" href="#calibre_link-2035" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">822</sup></a> that is, “The Body of Brahma”,<a id="calibre_link-1170" href="#calibre_link-2036" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">823</sup></a> or “Become Dhamma”, that is, “Become Brahma”.<a id="calibre_link-1171" href="#calibre_link-2037" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">824</sup></a></div>
<div class="fmtx1">10. ‘There comes a time, Vasettha, when, sooner or later after a long period, this world contracts.<a id="calibre_link-1172" href="#calibre_link-2038" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">825</sup></a> At a time of contraction, beings are mostly born in the Abhassara Brahma world. And there they dwell, mind-made, feeding on delight, self-luminous, moving through the air, glorious &mdash; and they stay like that for a very long time. But sooner or later, after a very long period, this world begins to expand again. At a time of expansion, the beings from the Abhassara Brahma world, [85] having passed away from there, are mostly reborn in this  world. Here they dwell, mind-made, feeding on delight, self-luminous, moving through the air, glorious<a id="calibre_link-1173" href="#calibre_link-2039" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">826</sup></a> &mdash; and they stay like that for a very long time.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">11. ‘At that period, Vāseṭṭha, there was just one mass of water, and all was darkness, blinding darkness. Neither moon nor sun appeared, no constellations or stars appeared, night and day were not distinguished, nor months and fortnights, no years or seasons, and no male and female, beings being reckoned just as beings.<a id="calibre_link-1174" href="#calibre_link-2040" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">827</sup></a> And sooner or later, after a very long period of time, savoury earth<a id="calibre_link-1175" href="#calibre_link-2041" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">828</sup></a> spread itself over the waters where those beings were. It looked just like the skin that forms itself over hot milk as it cools. It was endowed with colour, smell and taste. It was the colour of fine ghee or butter, and it was very sweet, like pure wild honey.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">12. ‘Then some being of a greedy nature said: “I say, what can this be?” and tasted the savoury earth on its finger. In so doing, it became taken with the flavour, and craving arose in it.<a id="calibre_link-1176" href="#calibre_link-2042" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">829</sup></a> Then other beings, taking their cue from that one, also tasted the stuff with their fingers. They too were taken with the flavour, and craving arose in them. So they set to with their hands, breaking off pieces of the stuff in order to eat it. And [86] the result of this was that their self-luminance disappeared. And as a result of the disappearance of their self-luminance, the moon and the sun appeared, night and day were distinguished, months and fortnights appeared, and the year and its seasons. To that extent the world re-evolved.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">13. ‘And those beings continued for a very long time feasting on this savoury earth, feeding on it and being nourished by it. And as they did so, their bodies became coarser,<a id="calibre_link-1177" href="#calibre_link-2043" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">830</sup></a> and a difference in looks developed among them. Some beings became good-looking, others ugly. And the good-looking ones despised the others, saying: “We are better-looking than they are.” And because they became arrogant and conceited about their looks, the savoury earth disappeared. At this they came together and lamented, crying: “Oh that flavour! Oh that flavour!” And so nowadays when people say: “Oh that flavour!” when they get something nice, they are repeating an ancient saying without realising it.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">14. ‘And then, when the savoury earth had disappeared, [87] a fungus<a id="calibre_link-1178" href="#calibre_link-2044" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">831</sup></a> cropped up, in the manner of a mushroom. It was  of a good colour, smell, and taste. It was the colour of fine ghee or butter, and it was very sweet, like pure wild honey. And those beings set to and ate the fungus. And this lasted for a very long time. And as they continued to feed on the fungus, so their bodies became coarser still, and the difference in their looks increased still more. And the good-looking ones despised the others ... And because they became arrogant and conceited about their looks, the sweet fungus disappeared. Next, creepers appeared, shooting up like bamboo..., and they too were very sweet, like pure wild honey.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">15. ‘And those beings set to and fed on those creepers. And as they did so, their bodies became even coarser, and the difference in their looks increased still more... [88] And they became still more arrogant, and so the creepers disappeared too. At this they came together and lamented, crying: “Alas, our creeper’s gone! What have we lost!” And so now today when people, on being asked why they are upset, say: “Oh, what have we lost!” they are repeating an ancient saying without realising it.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">16. ‘And then, after the creepers had disappeared, rice appeared in open spaces,<a id="calibre_link-1179" href="#calibre_link-2045" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">832</sup></a> free from powder and from husks, fragrant and clean-grained.<a id="calibre_link-1180" href="#calibre_link-2046" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">833</sup></a> And what they had taken in the evening for supper had grown again and was ripe in the morning, and what they had taken in the morning for breakfast was ripe again by evening, with no sign of reaping. And these beings set to and fed on this rice, and this lasted for a very long time. And as they did so, their bodies became coarser still, and the difference in their looks became even greater. And the females developed female sex-organs,<a id="calibre_link-1181" href="#calibre_link-2047" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">834</sup></a> and the males developed male organs. And the women became excessively preoccupied with men, and the men with women. Owing to this excessive preoccupation with each other, passion was aroused, and their bodies burnt with lust. And later, because of this burning, they indulged in sexual activity.<a id="calibre_link-1182" href="#calibre_link-2048" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">835</sup></a>  But those who saw them indulging threw dust, ashes or [89] cow-dung at them, crying: “Die, you filthy beast! How can one being do such things to another!” Just as today, in some districts, when a daughter-in-law is led out, some people throw dirt at her, some ashes, and some cow-dung, without realising that they are repeating an ancient observance. What  was considered bad form in those days is now considered good form.<a id="calibre_link-1183" href="#calibre_link-2049" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">836</sup></a></div>
<div class="fmtx1">17. ‘And those beings who in those days indulged in sex were not allowed into a village or town for one or two months. Accordingly those who indulged for an excessively long period in such immoral practices began to build themselves dwellings so as to indulge under cover.<a id="calibre_link-1184" href="#calibre_link-2050" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">837</sup></a></div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘Now it occurred to one of those beings who was inclined to laziness: “Well now, why should I be bothered to gather rice in the evening for supper and in the morning for breakfast? Why shouldn’t I gather it all at once for both meals?” And he did so. Then another one came to him and said: “Come on, let’s go rice-gathering.” “No need, my friend, I’ve gathered enough for both meals.” Then the other, following his example, gathered enough rice for two days at a time, saying: “That should be about enough.” Then another being came and said [90] to that second one: “Come on, let’s go rice-gathering.” “No need, my friend, I’ve gathered enough for two days.” (<i class="calibre9">The same for 4, then 8, days</i>). However, when those beings made a store of rice and lived on that, husk-powder and husk began to envelop the grain, and where it was reaped it did not grow again, and the cut place showed, and the rice grew in separate clusters.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">18. ‘And then those beings came together lamenting: “Wicked ways have become rife among us: at first we were mind-made, feeding on delight... (<i class="calibre9">all events repeated down to the latest development, each fresh change being said to be due to</i>  ‘wicked and unwholesome ways’)... [91] [92] and the rice grows in separate clusters. So now let us divide up the rice into fields with boundaries.” So they did so.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">19. ‘Then, Vāseṭṭha, one greedy-natured being, while watching over his own plot, took another plot that was not given to him, and enjoyed the fruits of it. So they seized hold of him and said: “You’ve done a wicked thing, taking another’s plot like that! Don’t ever do such a thing again!” “I won’t”, he said, but he did the same thing a second and a third time. Again he was seized and rebuked, and some hit him with their fists, some with stones, and some with sticks. And in this way, Vasettha, taking what was not given, and censuring, and lying, and punishment, took their origin.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">20. ‘Then those beings came together and lamented the arising of these evil things among them: taking what was not given, censuring, lying and punishment. And they thought: “Suppose we were to appoint a certain being who would show anger where anger was due, censure those who deserved it, and banish those who deserved banishment! And in return, we would grant him a share of the rice.” [93] So they went to the one among them who was the handsomest, the best-looking, the most pleasant and capable, and asked him to do this for them in return for a share of the rice, and he agreed.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">21. “‘The People’s Choice” is the meaning of Mahā-Sammata,  <a id="calibre_link-1185" href="#calibre_link-2051" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">838</sup></a> which is the first regular title<a id="calibre_link-1186" href="#calibre_link-2052" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">839</sup></a> to be introduced. “Lord Of The Fields” is the meaning of Khattiya,<a id="calibre_link-1187" href="#calibre_link-2053" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">840</sup></a> the second such title.

<div class="fmtx1">22. ‘Then some of these beings thought: “Evil things have appeared among beings, such as taking what is not given, censuring, lying, punishment and banishment.

They made leaf-huts in forest places and meditated in them. With the smoking fire gone out, with pestle cast aside, gathering alms for their evening and morning meals, they went away to a village, town or royal city to seek their food, and then they returned to their leaf-huts to meditate. People saw this and noted how they meditated. “They Meditate”<a id="calibre_link-1191" href="#calibre_link-2057" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">844</sup></a> is the meaning of Jhayaka,<a id="calibre_link-1192" href="#calibre_link-2058" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">845</sup></a> which is the second regular title to be introduced.</div>

At that time it was regarded as a low designation, but now it is the higher. This, then, Vāseṭṭha, is the origin of the class of Brahmins in accordance with the ancient titles that were introduced for them.

<div class="fmtx">[99] 1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. Once the Lord was styaing at Nālandā in Pāvārika’s mango-grove. And the Venerable Sāriputta came to see the Lord, saluted him, sat down to one side, and said:<a id="calibre_link-1203" href="#calibre_link-1964" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">856</sup></a> ‘It is clear to me, Lord, that there never has been, never will be and is not now another ascetic or Brahmin who is better or more enlightened than the Lord.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘You have spoken boldly with a bull’s voice, Sāriputta, you have roared the lion’s roar of certainty. How is this? Have all the Arahant Buddhas of the past appeared to you, and were the minds of all those Lords open to you, so as to say: “These Lords were of such virtue, such was their teaching, [100] such their wisdom, such their way, such their liberation”?’ ‘No, Lord.’ ‘And have you perceived all the Arahant Buddhas who will appear in the future?’ ‘No, Lord.’ ‘Well then, Sāriputta, you know me as the Arahant Buddha, and do you know: “The Lord is of such virtue, such his teaching, such his wisdom, such his way, such his liberation”?’ ‘No, Lord.’ ‘So, Sāriputta, you do not have knowledge of the minds of the Buddhas of the past, the future or the present. Then, Sāriputta,have you not spoken boldly with a bull’s voice and roared the lion’s roar of certainty with your declaration?’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">2. ‘Lord, the minds of the Arahant Buddhas of the past, future and present are not open to me. But I know the drift of the Dhamma. Lord, it is as if there were a [101] royal frontier city, with mighty bastions and a mighty encircling wall in which was a single gate, at which was a gatekeeper, wise, skilled and clever, who kept out strangers and let in those he knew. And he, constantly patrolling and following along a path, might not see the joins and clefts in the bastion, even  such as a cat might creep through. But whatever larger creatures entered or left the city, must all go through this very gate. And it seems to me, Lord, that the drift of the Dhamma is the same. All those Arahant Buddhas of the past attained to supreme enlightenment by abandoning the five hindrances, defilements of mind which weaken understanding, having firmly established the four foundations of mindfulness in their minds, and realised the seven factors of enlightenment as they really are. All the Arahant Buddhas of the future will do likewise, and you, Lord, who are now the Arahant, fully-enlightened Buddha, have done the same.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘So I came once [102] to the Blessed Lord to listen to Dhamma. And the Blessed Lord taught me Dhamma most excellently and perfectly, contrasting the dark with the light. And as he did so, I gained insight into that Dhamma, and from among the various things I established one in particular, which was serene confidence<a id="calibre_link-1204" href="#calibre_link-1965" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">857</sup></a> in the Teacher, that the Blessed Lord is a fully-enlightened Buddha, that the Dhamma is well taught by the Blessed Lord, and that the order of monks is well-trained.</div>

This is the unsurpassed teaching in regard to the wholesome factors. This the Blessed Lord fully comprehends, and beyond it lies nothing further to be comprehended; and in such understanding there is no other ascetic or Brahmin who is greater or more enlightened than the Blessed Lord, as regards the wholesome factors.</div>

Thus, one tells by a visible sign, saying: “This is what you think, this is in your mind, your thought is like this.” And however much one declares, it is so and not otherwise. That is the first way. Or, one tells not by a visible sign, but through hearing a sound made by humans, non-humans,<a id="calibre_link-1209" href="#calibre_link-1970" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">862</sup></a> or devas ...That is the second way. Or one tells not by a sound uttered, [104] but by applying one’s mind and attending to something conveyed by sound ... That is the third way.

What is the “un-Ariyan” supernormal power? Here some ascetic or Brahmin enjoys various supernormal powers: being one, he becomes many &mdash; being many, he becomes one; he appears and disappears; he passes through fences, walls and mountains unhindered as if through air; he sinks into the ground and emerges from it as if it were water; he walks on the water without breaking the surface as if on land; he flies cross-legged  through the sky like a bird with wings; he even touches and strokes with his hand the sun and moon, mighty and powerful as they are; and he travels in the body as far as the Brahma world. That is the ʺun-Ariyariʺsupernormal power. And what is the “Ariyan” supernormal power? Here a monk, if he wishes: “Let me abide with the disgusting<a id="calibre_link-1238" href="#calibre_link-1999" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">891</sup></a> not feeling disgust”, can so abide, and if he wishes: “Let me [113] abide with the non-disgusting feeling disgust”, he can so abide, <i class="calibre9">also feeling either disgust or non-disgust in the presence of both</i> ... or: “Ignoring both the disgusting and the non-disgusting may I abide in equanimity, mindful and clearly aware”, he can so abide.

Even the white-robed lay [118] followers were disgusted, displeased and repelled when they saw that their doctrine and discipline was so ill-proclaimed, so unedifyingly displayed, and so ineffectual in calming the passions, having been proclaimed by one not fully enlightened, and now with its support gone, without an arbiter.<a id="calibre_link-1248" href="#calibre_link-1855" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">901</sup></a></div>
<div class="fmtx1">2. Now the novice Cunda, who had spent the Rains at Pāvā, came to Sāmāgama to see the Venerable Ananda.

The Venerable Ananda said: ‘Cunda, that is something that ought to be reported to the Blessed Lord. Let us go and tell him.’ ‘Very good, sir’, said Cunda.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">3. So they went to the Lord and told him. He said: ‘Cunda,  here is a doctrine and discipline that is ill-proclaimed, [119] unedifyingly displayed and ineffectual in calming the passions because its proclaimer was not fully enlightened.</div>

<div class="fmtx1">‘But if one were to use that expression properly: [127] “He sees, but does not see”, it would be like this.

If he were to deduct anything from it, thinking: “In this way it will be purerʺ, he does not see it.

<div class="fmtx1">18. ‘And thus you must train yourselves, being assembled in harmony and without dissension.

What are they? Firstly, a foolish person<a id="calibre_link-1274" href="#calibre_link-1881" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">927</sup></a> takes pleasure and delight in killing living beings. Secondly, [131] someone takes pleasure and delight in taking that which is not given. Thirdly, someone takes pleasure and delight in telling lies. Fourthly, someone gives himself up to the indulgence in and enjoyment of the pleasures of the five senses. These are the four kinds of life devoted to  pleasure which are low, vulgar,... not leading to disenchantment, ... to enlightenment, to Nibbāna.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">24. ‘And it may be that those of other sects might say: “Are the followers of the Sakyan given to these four forms of pleasure-seeking?” They should be told: “No!” for they would not be speaking correctly about you, they would be slandering you with false and untrue statements.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">ʹThere are, Cunda, these four kinds of life devoted to pleasure which are entirely conducive<a id="calibre_link-1275" href="#calibre_link-1882" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">928</sup></a> to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to tranquillity, to realisation, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna. What are they? Firstly, a monk, detached from all sense-desires <a id="calibre_link-1276" href="#calibre_link-1883" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">929</sup></a> detached from unwholesome mental states, enters and remains in the first jhāna, which is with thinking and pondering, born of detachment, filled with delight and happiness. And with the subsiding of thinking and pondering, by gaining inner tranquillity and oneness of mind, he enters and remains in the second jhāna, which is without thinking and pondering, born of concentration, filled with delight and happiness. Again, with the fading of delight, remaining imperturbable, mindful and clearly aware, he experiences in himself that joy of which the Noble Ones say: “Happy is he who dwells with equanimity and mindfulness”, he enters and remains in the third jhāna. Again, having given up pleasure [132] and pain, and with the disappearance of former gladness and sadness, he enters and remains in the fourth jhāna, which is beyond pleasure and pain, and purified by equanimity and mindfulness.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">‘These are the four kinds of life devoted to pleasure which are entirely conducive to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to tranquillity, to realisation, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna.

<div class="fmtx1">25. ‘Then such wanderers might ask: “Well then, those who are given to these four forms of pleasure-seeking - how many fruits, how many benefits can they expect?” And you should reply: “They can expect four fruits, four benefits. What are  they? The first is when a monk by the destruction of three fetters has become a Stream-Winner, no more subject to rebirth in lower worlds, firmly established, destined for full enlightenment; the second is when a monk by the complete destruction of three fetters and the reduction of greed, hatred and delusion, has become a Once-Returner, and having returned once more to this world, will put an end to suffering; the third is when a monk, by the complete destruction of the five lower fetters, has been spontaneously reborn, and there will reach Nibbāna without returning from that world. The fourth is when a monk, by the destruction of the corruptions in this very life has, by his own knowledge and realisation, attained to Arahantship, to the deliverance of heart and through wisdom. Such are the four fruits and the four benefits that one given to these four forms of pleasure-seeking can expect.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">26. ‘Then such wanderers [133] might say: “The doctrines of the Sakyan’s followers are not well-founded.” They should be told: “Friend, the Lord who knows and sees has taught and proclaimed to his disciples principles which are not to be transgressed as long as life shall last. Just like a locking-post<a id="calibre_link-1277" href="#calibre_link-1884" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">930</sup></a>  or an iron post which is deep-based, well-planted and unshakeable, immovable are these doctrines he has taught. And any monk who is an Arahant, whose corruptions are destroyed, who has lived the life, done what was to be done, laid down the burden, gained the true goal, who has completely destroyed the fetter of becoming, and is liberated by supreme insight, is incapable of doing nine things: (1) He is incapable of deliberately taking the life of a living being; (2) he is incapable of taking what is not given so as to constitute theft; (3) he is incapable of sexual intercourse; (4) he is incapable of telling a deliberate lie; (5) he is incapable of storing up goods for sensual indulgence as he did formerly in the household life; (6) he is incapable of acting wrongly through attachment; (7) he is incapable of acting wrongly through hatred; (8) he is incapable of acting wrongly through folly; (9) he is incapable of acting wrongly through fear.

<div class="fmtx1">27. ‘Or such wanderers might say: “As regards past times,  the ascetic Gotama displays boundless knowledge and insight, but not about the future, as to what it will be and how it will be.” That would be to suppose that knowledge and insight about one thing are to be produced by knowledge and insight about something else, as fools imagine. As regards the past, the Tathāgata has knowledge of past lives. He can remember as far back as he wishes.

If he lives the household life, he will become a ruler, a wheel-turning righteous monarch of the law, conqueror of the four quarters, who has established the security of his realm and is possessed of the seven treasures. These are: the Wheel Treasure, the Elephant Treasure, the Horse Treasure, the Jewel Treasure, the Woman Treasure, the Householder Treasure, and, as seventh, the Counsellor Treasure. He has more than a thousand sons who are heroes, of heroic stature, conquerors of the hostile army. He dwells having conquered this sea-girt land without stick or sword, by the law. But if he goes forth from the household life into homelessness, he will become an Arahant, a fully-enlightened Buddha, who has drawn back the veil from the world.</div>

And so, Lord, out of respect for my father’s words, which I revere, honour and hold sacred, I have got up thus early to pay homage in this way to the six directions.’ ‘But, householder’s son, that is not the right way to pay homage to the six directions according to the Ariyan discipline.’ ‘Well, Lord, how should one pay homage to the six directions according to the Ariyan discipline?

<div class="fmtx">[207] 1.1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. Once the Lord was touring in the Malla country with a large company of about five hundred monks. Arrived at Pāvā, the Mallas’ capital, he stayed in the mango-grove of Cunda the smith.<a id="calibre_link-1359" href="#calibre_link-1496" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">1012</sup></a></div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.2. Now at that time a new meeting-hall of the Mallas of Pāvā, called Ubbhaṭaka,<a id="calibre_link-1360" href="#calibre_link-1497" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">1013</sup></a> had recently been built, and it had not yet been occupied by any ascetic or Brahmin, or indeed by any human being. Hearing that the Lord was staying in Cunda’s mango-grove, the Mallas of Pāvā went to see him. Having saluted him, they sat down to one side and said: ‘Lord, the Mallas of Pāvā have recently erected a new meeting-hall called Ubbhataka, and it has not yet been occupied by any ascetic or Brahmin, or indeed by any human being. [208] May the Blessed Lord be the first to use it! Should he do so, that would be for the lasting good and happiness of the Mallas of Pāvā.′ And the Lord consented by silence.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.3. Noting his assent, the Mallas rose, saluted him, passed out to his right and went to the meeting-hall. They spread mats all round, arranged seats, put out a water-pot and an oil-lamp, and then, returning to the Lord, saluted him, sat down to one side and reported what they had done, saying: ‘Whenever the Blessed Lord is ready.’</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.4. Then the Lord dressed, took his robe and bowl, and went to the meeting-hall with his monks. There he washed his feet, entered the hall and sat down against the central pillar, facing east. The monks, having washed their feet, entered the hall and sat down along the western wall facing east, [209] with the Lord in front of them. The Pāvā Mallas washed their feet, entered the hall, and sat down along the eastern wall facing west, with the Lord in front of them. Then the  Lord spoke to the Mallas on Dhamma till far into the night, instructing, inspiring, firing and delighting them. Then he dismissed them, saying: ‘Vāsetthas,<a id="calibre_link-1361" href="#calibre_link-1498" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">1014</sup></a> the night has passed away.<a id="calibre_link-1362" href="#calibre_link-1499" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">1015</sup></a> Now do as you think fit.’ ‘Very good, Lord’, replied the Mallas. And they got up, saluted the Lord, and went out, passing him by on the right.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.5. As soon as the Mallas had gone the Lord, surveying the monks sitting silently all about, said to the Venerable Sāriputta: ‘The monks are free from sloth-and-torpor,<a id="calibre_link-1363" href="#calibre_link-1500" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">1016</sup></a> Sāriputta. You think of a discourse on Dhamma to give to them. My back aches, I want to stretch it.’ ‘Very good, Lord’, replied Sāriputta. Then the Lord, having folded his robe in four, lay down on his right side in the lion-posture,<a id="calibre_link-1364" href="#calibre_link-1501" class="calibre4"><sup class="calibre11">1017</sup></a> with one foot on the other, mindful and clearly aware, and bearing in mind the time to arise.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.6. Now at that time the Nigantha Nātaputta [210] had just died at Pāvā.

You would have thought they were bent on killing each other. Even the white-robed lay followers were disgusted when they saw that their doctrine and discipline was so ill-proclaimed,... having been proclaimed by one not fully-enlightened and now with its support gone, without an arbiter.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">1.7. And the Venerable Sāriputta addressed the monks, referring to this situation, and said: ‘So ill-proclaimed was their teaching and discipline, so unedifyingly displayed, and so ineffectual in calming the passions, having been proclaimed by one who was not fully enlightened. [211] But, friends, this Dhamma has been well proclaimed by the Lord, the fully-enlightened One.

<div class="end"><a id="calibre_link-1781" href="#calibre_link-348" class="calibre4">1</a>   The Buddha’s dates are doubtful. Lamotte (1958) took 566 -486 B.C. as a working hypothesis, but recently many scholars have argued for a later dating, though with no exact consensus. Perhaps ‘ca. 480-400’ would be a reasonable guess. Lamotte’s dating is not impossible, but the Sri Lankan tradition of 623-543 and other even earlier Oriental datings seem ruled out.</div><div class="end"><a id="calibre_link-1782" href="#calibre_link-349" class="calibre4">2</a>   <i class="calibre9">Sutta</i>. There is no satisfactory English translation for this, and ‘discourse’ is used as a makeshift rendering. It is virtually synonymous with <i class="calibre9">suttanta,</i> favoured in volumes ii and iii by Rhys Davids and Carpenter. The literal meaning is ‘thread’, and the Sanskrit form is  <i class="calibre9">sūtra.</i> Typically, a Sutta, which may be all or partly in verse, though prose is the norm, gives a discourse by the Buddha or one of his leading disciples, set within a slight narrative framework and always introduced by the words ‘Thus have I heard’, having supposedly been thus recited by the Ven. Ananda at the First Council. Mahayana <i class="calibre9">sūtras</i> are normally much longer and more elaborate.</div><div class="end"><a id="calibre_link-1783" href="#calibre_link-350" class="calibre4">3</a>   <i class="calibre9">Hīnayāna</i>. This term, meaning ‘lesser vehicle or career’, is sometimes used polemically by Mahayana writers for those Buddhists who do not accept their doctrines. Hence it has come in modern times to be applied to the Theravada school, though it was originally applied to a now extinct school called the Sarvastivadins. There is therefore no justification for applying it to the Buddhism of the south-east Asian countries using the Pali Canon.</div><div class="end"><a id="calibre_link-1784" href="#calibre_link-351" class="calibre4">4</a>   <i class="calibre9">Sankhdra.</i> The various meanings of this word are well set out in BDic, the most important being that of ‘formations’ (the Ven. Nyanatiloka’s word) in various senses. Here it means ‘anything formed or compounded’ in the most general sense. In the formula of dependent origination (q.v.) the term is rendered ‘Karma-formations’, and denotes the karmic patterns, good or bad, produced by past ignorance, which go to shape the character of the new individual. As one of the five groups of aggregates <i class="calibre9">(khandhas)</i> the <i class="calibre9">sankhdras</i> are ‘mental formations’, including some functions that are not karmic.</div><div class="end"><a id="calibre_link-1785" href="#calibre_link-352" class="calibre4">5</a>   As, for instance, in the often quoted story of the thirty young men told to seek ‘themselves’ <i class="calibre9">(attanam)</i> (Vinaya, Mahavagga 14.3). Though the word used here is accusative singular, there is no justification for interpreting it as ‘the Self’.</div><div class="end"><a id="calibre_link-1786" href="#calibre_link-353" class="calibre4">6</a>   The difficulty of translating Pali (even when one thinks one knows the meaning!) is sometimes considerable. The structure of Pali somewhat resembles that of classical Latin, though with even greater complications and a particular propensity for participial constructions. The problem can be illustrated by a typical example. Sutta 28 opens:<div class="afmtx"><div class="fmtx2">Evam me sutam. Ekam samayam Bhagava Nalandayam viharati Pavarikambavane. Atha kho ayasma Sariputto yena Bhagava ten’ upasamkami, upasamkamitva Bhagavantam abhivadetva ekamantam nisidi. Ekamantam nisinno kho ayasma Sariputto Bhagavantam etad avoca...</div>
</div>
<div class="bmtx">Literally:<div class="afmtx"><div class="fmtx2"><i class="calibre9">Thus by-me [was] heard. One time Blessed-One at-Ndlandd stays in-Pdvarika’s-mango-grove. Then too Venerable Sariputta where Blessed-One [was] there approached, having-approached Blessed-One having-saluted to-one-side sat-down. To-one-side having-sat-down too Venerable Sariputta to-Blessed-One this said...</i></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx2">We render this more economically:<div class="afmtx"><div class="fmtx2">‘Thus have I heard. Once the Lord was staying at Nāḷandā in Pāvārika’s mango-grove. And the Venerable Sāriputta came to see the Lord, saluted him, sat down to one side and said...’</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx2">It only remains to add that, as far as verse-passages are concerned, I have done my best. I have made no attempt to reproduce original metrical patterns. Here, too, taste has changed since the days of the earlier translators.</div>
</div><div class="end"><a id="calibre_link-1787" href="#calibre_link-354" class="calibre4">7</a>   Sometimes there is doubt about the original form of a word. Thus in the Pali Canon, Gotama before his enlightenment is referred to as the <i class="calibre9">Bodhisatta</i>: a term much better known, with some doctrinal development, in its Sanskrit form of <i class="calibre9">Bodhisattva</i>, ‘enlightenment-being’. But it has been suggested that the element <i class="calibre9">-satta</i> in Pali here stands not for <i class="calibre9">sattva</i> ‘being’ but for <i class="calibre9">sakta</i> ‘intent on’. In this case <i class="calibre9">Bodhisatta</i> would mean ‘one intent on enlightenment’. On philological grounds alone, at least, we cannot be sure which explanation is right.</div><div class="end"><a id="calibre_link-1788" href="#calibre_link-355" class="calibre4">8</a>   This edition has its faults, being based on the somewhat fortuitous collection of manuscripts available at the time. Other and probably better editions exist, printed in Sri Lanka, Burma and Thailand. There is even one passage in Sutta 1 where the old translation by Gogerly (1846, reprinted in <i class="calibre9">Sept Suttas Palis</i> by P. Grimblot, Paris 1876) has a better reading than in the PTS edition.</div><div class="end"><a id="calibre_link-1789" href="#calibre_link-356" class="calibre4">9</a>   The archaising, quasi-Biblical (in the old-fashioned sense) style adopted by Professor Rhys Davids and others may have been almost a necessity at the time, but is now not only irritating to many modern readers &mdash; it is often barely intelligible to them. Also, the early translators’ technical terms have often been superseded. It must also be said that the Rhys Davids translation, the latter part of which was made by Mrs Rhys Davids, is often careless, with some curious omissions and inconsistencies. That said, tribute must be paid to the pioneering husband and wife team for the vast amount  of learning they jointly put into their work. Many of Rhys Davids’s introductions to individual Suttas, for instance, are still a joy to read, and many of his interpretations have stood the test of time well &mdash; better indeed than most of those later developed by his wife.</div><div class="end"><a id="calibre_link-1790" href="#calibre_link-357" class="calibre4">10</a>   The arguments of Rhys Davids, when, in 1899, he argued against those who unjustifiably disparaged the Sinhalese tradition (and who, much later, were to be joined by his own widow!), are echoed today by a leading specialist, A.K. Warder, who writes in the preface to vol. iii of the PTC (1963):<div class="afmtx"><div class="fmtx2">The <i class="calibre9">Pāḷi,</i> as the only complete recension of the original canon extant, must play the central part in reconstructing such an original [i.e. ‘as rehearsed by the Buddha’s followers’]. The possibility of establishing a substantial amount of such an original Buddhist Canon seems now vouched for by the comparisons made especially by É. Lamotte, in his most valuable <i class="calibre9">Histoire du Bouddhisme Indien</i> (Vol. I, Louvain, 1958), where the value of the basic Pāḷi texts on Buddhist doctrine &mdash; so often thrust aside in recent years as unauthentic Sinhalese perversions and fabrications probably less faithful to the original doctrine than even the Mahāyāna Sūtras &mdash; is reaffirmed by collation with whatever is available of the other recensions of the so-called ‘Hīnayāna’ Canon. A variety of methods now lie to hand for ascertaining the original Buddhist doctrine (presumably of the Buddha himself &mdash; who else?): (1) collation of the early canons, (2) collation of the <i class="calibre9">mātikā</i> [see n.1012], (3) the recorded history of the doctrinal peculiarities of the Buddhist schools, (4) comparison and contrast with non-Buddhist schools, (5) chronological distinctions among the texts on grounds of vocabulary and grammatical usages, (6) chronological distinctions among the texts on grounds of metrical usages.</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx2">It should be added here that A.K. Warder is himself the leading authority on point (6).</div>
</div><div class="fmtx">SUTTA 1</div>
<div class="end"><a id="calibre_link-1672" href="#calibre_link-358" class="calibre4">11</a>   There is a separate translation of this Sutta by Bhikkhu Bodhi, <i class="calibre9">The All-Embracing Net of Views: The Brahmajāla Sutta and its Commentaries</i> (BPS 1978). This is most valuable for its introduction as well as the translated commentarial material. Beside the Rhys Davids translation (RD) there is also the somewhat abridged version by Mrs A.A.G.

And if it were infinite, one living in this world would be able to experience the happiness of the heavenly worlds and the suffering of the hells, etc. If one holds it to be both finite and infinite, one would incur the errors of both the previous positions.

Perhaps the Buddha told the King this story on that occasion, and the incident was later tactfully transferred from the King of Kosala to an imaginary Brahmin ‘with royal powers’ living in the neighbouring kingdom of Magadha.</div><div class="end"><a id="calibre_link-1956" href="#calibre_link-519" class="calibre4">172</a>   ‘Lord Broadacres’ (RD).</div><div class="end"><a id="calibre_link-1957" href="#calibre_link-520" class="calibre4">173</a>   <i class="calibre9">Purohitaṁ.</i> ‘The king’s head-priest (brahmanic), or domestic chaplain, acting at the same time as a sort of Prime Minister’ (PED).</div><div class="end"><a id="calibre_link-1958" href="#calibre_link-521" class="calibre4">174</a>   The Khattiyas, counsellors, Brahmins and householders.</div><div class="end"><a id="calibre_link-1959" href="#calibre_link-522" class="calibre4">175</a>   Elephants, cavalry, chariots and infantry.</div><div class="end"><a id="calibre_link-1960" href="#calibre_link-523" class="calibre4">176</a>   By knowing the workings of kamma: good fortune now is due to past kamma, and good deeds performed now will have similar results in the future (DA).</div><div class="end"><a id="calibre_link-1961" href="#calibre_link-524" class="calibre4">177</a>   Cf.

He writes:<div class="afmtx"><div class="fmtx2">When really frightened the oracle generally fell back on some remedy full of pain and blood. The medieval plan of burning heretics alive had not yet been invented. But the history of uncivilized man, if it were written, would provide a vast list of victims, all of them innocent, who died or suffered to expiate some portent or <i class="calibre9">monstrum...</i> with which they had nothing whatever to do ... The sins of the modern world in dealing with heretics and witches have perhaps been more gigantic than those of primitive men, but one can hardly rise from the record of these ancient observances without being haunted by the judgement of the Roman poet: ‘Tantum religio potuit suadere malorum’ [‘To so many evils was religion able to persuade men’], and feeling with him that the lightening of this cloud, the taming of this blind dragon, must rank among the very greatest services that Hellenism wrought for mankind.</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx2">Murray seems only to think of human victims, and to be totally oblivious to the fact that Buddhism had, a century before Socrates, been much more radical in its abolition of cruelty to humans and animals, and with more lasting results, at least as far as India and neighbouring countries were concerned. </div>

It is doubtful whether either term originally meant what it was later taken to mean. See Introduction, p. 40f. ‘A painful or beast-like rebirth’ might express the meaning better.

Nyānaponika Mahāthera (Wheel Publication 67 &mdash; 69, BPS, Kandy 1964). <div class="bmtx">The Sutta is a composite one, many portions of which are found separately in other parts of the Canon, as listed by RD. No doubt it contains the basic facts about the Buddha’s last days, but various late and more than dubious elements have been incorporated in it-a process which continued in the later Sanskrit versions (produced by the Sarvāstivādins and other schools), which are known to us mainly from the Chinese and Tibetan translations (though some Sanskrit fragments have been found). For E. Waldschmidt’s (German) study of these, see A.K. Warder, <i class="calibre9">Indian Buddhism</i> (2nd ed., Delhi 1980). The Tibetan version is translated into English in W.W. Rockhill, <i class="calibre9">Life of the Buddha</i> (2nd ed., London 1907), pp. 123-147. It should perhaps be mentioned that the (expanded, Sanskrit-based) <i class="calibre9">Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra</i> is sometimes cited as evidence for the belief in a supreme self in Mahayana Buddhism. One Chinese version does indeed contain a passage to this effect, but this is a late interpolation, and is not representative of the general Mahayana position.</div>

It could therefore mean either ‘the tender parts of a pig’ or ‘what pigs enjoy’ (cf. note 46 in LDB). What is quite clear is that the old commentators did not know for certain what it did mean. DA gives three possibilities: 1. The flesh of a wild pig, neither too young nor too old, which had come to hand without being killed, 2. soft boiled rice cooked with ‘the five products of the cow’, or 3. a kind of elixir of life <i class="calibre9">(rasāyana)</i> (cf. next note). Modern interpreters from RD onwards have favoured truffles as a plausible explanation, and some evidence for this has been adduced. Trevor Ling, in n.31 to his revision of the RD translation of this Sutta (<i class="calibre9">The Buddhaʹs Philosophy of Man</i> (Everyman’s Library, London 1981, p. 218), remarks: ‘This explanation seems intended to avoid offence to vegetarian readers or hearers. Rhys Davids’s statement that Buddhists “have been mostly vegetarians,  and are increasingly so”, is difficult to accept.’ Be that as it may (and in fact Eastern Theravada Buddhists have rarely been vegetarians, though some are now, almost certainly under Western influence!), the question of vegetarianism has frequently been raised in the Buddhist field.<div class="bmtx">The standard Theravada position is set out in the Jivaka Sutta (MN 55), in which the Buddha tells Jivaka that monks must not eat the meat of any animal concerning which they have seen, heard or suspect that it was specially killed for them. The Buddha rejected Devadatta’s proposal to forbid meat-eating altogether to the monks. Living on alms as they did in the conditions of rural India at the time, they would either have gravely embarrassed those who offered them food, or starved if they had refused all meat. At the same time, under modern conditions, especially in the West, the question does arise as to whether the Sangha might not educate the laity into offering only vegetarian food. Many Western Buddhists (and not only Mahayanists) are in fact vegetarians today.</div>
<div class="bmtx">In many schools of Mahayana Buddhism, vegetarianism is the rule, and some writers have indulged in polemics against the Theravada school on this score. This, whatever may be said, has not always been purely for reasons of compassion. Shinran Shōnin, the founder of the Shin School in Japan, abolished compulsory vegetarianism along with celibacy because he considered it a form of penitential practice.</div>

Even Brewster, who normally follows RD, has changed it to ‘Accomplish earnestly!’, which is much better. Much has been made in some quarters of the fact that the Sarvastivadin version (and therefore the Tibetan translation) omits these words.

While we may not be convinced that this Sutta goes back to the Buddha personally (but equally &mdash; are we sure that it does not, in some form?), this is indeed the method he uses in discussions with a variety of interlocutors.

<div class="end"><a id="calibre_link-27" href="#calibre_link-971" class="calibre4">624</a>   This is generally regarded as the most important Sutta in the entire Pali Canon. It recurs verbatim at MN 10 as the Satipatthana Sutta, with the omission of verses 18-21. The text (or that of MN 10) has been separately translated a number of times, notably by Soma Thera as  <i class="calibre9">The Way of Mindfulness</i> (2nd ed. Colombo 1949, 3rd ed. BPS 1967). The important book <i class="calibre9">The Heart of Buddhist Meditation</i> by Nyāṇaponika Mahāthera (Colombo 1954, London 1973 and later) is essentially based on this Sutta and contains a translation, not only of this but of other relevant texts from the Pali Canon and from Mahayana sources (especially Santideva’s <i class="calibre9">Sikṣāsamuccaya).</i> The author’s remark in the Introduction (p. 14) should also be noted: ‘Among the Mahayana schools of the Far East, it is chiefly the Chinese Ch’an and Japanese Zen that are closest to the spirit of Satipaṭṭhāna. Notwithstanding the differences in method, aim and basic philosophical  conceptions, the connecting links with Satipaṭṭhāna are close and strong, and it is regrettable that they have hardly been stressed or noticed.’ It should however be mentioned that since those words were written, the realisation has begun to dawn that Zen has much in common with Theravāda in general, and the Satipaṭṭhāna method in particular &mdash; somewhat to the surprise of some who have overstressed the ‘uniqueness’ of Zen. The cross-headings in this Sutta correspond closely to those used by the Ven.

<div class="end"><a id="calibre_link-1810" href="#calibre_link-1286" class="calibre4">939</a>   This Sutta may seem the most uninteresting and unedifying of the entire Nikāya. Yet, properly considered, it has its interest, first, as an example of the forms Buddhist propaganda was perhaps sometimes obliged to assume, and also from the point of view of iconography, as some of the marks came to be depicted in images of the Buddha: the great reclining Buddha-figure in Wat Pho in Bangkok is a well-known example. RD has a wide-ranging introduction tracing the possible origins of such marks, which clearly must have been important in the minds of influential Brahmins in the time of the Buddha (see, e.g. DN 3). However, later Brahmin tradition has preserved very little about them. Certainly, many of them seem quite arbitrary and even difficult to distinguish clearly. Nevertheless, there are more traces of their influence in later Buddhist writing (and, as observed, iconography) than RD is anxious to admit, and there are even ‘eighty minor marks’ mentioned in addition to the thirty-two major ones here listed. Both lists, major and minor, are found in the  <i class="calibre9">Dharma-Samigraha</i> (ed. Kenjiu Kasawara and F. Max Müller, 1885, rep. Delhi 1981), carefully collated with the lists as they occur in the present Sutta and elsewhere. RD remarks that ‘most of the marks are so absurd, considered as marks of any human, that they are probably mythological in origin, and three or four seem to be solar.’ He adds that ‘our Suttanta seems gravely ironical in the contrast it makes between the absurdity of the marks and the beauty of the ethical qualities they are supposed, in the Suttanta, to mean.’ But it must be added that, however absurdly as regards the details, they are intended to show the relation between action  and karmic result, and they could have been used pedagogically to inculcate this lesson. Scholars are agreed on the fairly obvious fact that this is one of the latest texts in the Nikaya, and this is even hinted at in the commentary itself. The verses, ascribed to Ananda, show an exceptionally wide variety of metres, but all of late types. It is possible that someone tried to give this unpromising material some literary grace by dexterous versification. I considered trying to reproduce the different metrical forms in translation, but decided this was beyond my powers. Perhaps some other translator will attempt this one day.</div><div class="end"><a id="calibre_link-1811" href="#calibre_link-1287" class="calibre4">940</a>   <i class="calibre9">Mahāpurisa.</i> Though a ‘Great Man’, endowed with very special qualities, the Buddha as born on earth is still a man.

The purist may be shocked to find this not only in ‘popular Buddhism’ but actually enshrined in the Canon; but Mrs Rhys Davids offers a spirited defence of such things in the introduction to her translation of this Sutta. She quotes the list of canonical <i class="calibre9">parittas,</i> and a similar list also occurs at VM 13.31: the Ratana Sutta (Sn 222ff., Khp 6), Khandha Paritta (AN 4.67), Dhajagga Paritta (SN 11.1.3), and Mora Paritta (Ja 159), beside the present Sutta. These are said to be efficacious through ten thousand million world-systems. DA, however, advises the use of the Metta Sutta in the first place, then the Dhajagga and Ratana Suttas. Only if, after a week, these do not work, should the Ātānātiya be resorted to &mdash; which would be of no use in the kind of emergency envisaged in the text! But the mention of the Metta Sutta is interesting because the Khandha Sutta (delivered after a monk had died of a snake-bite) enjoins the practice of loving-kindness to all beings as a form of self-protection. Like certain truthful declarations, this can have powerful effects. See Piyadassi Thera, <i class="calibre9">The Book of Protection</i> (BPS 1975).<div class="bmtx">A Tibetan version of this Sutta exists, and a fragment of a Sanskrit version has been found in Central Asia, but this differs considerably from the Pali. It is quoted with translation by K. Saha, <i class="calibre9">Buddhism in Central Asia</i>  (Calcutta 1970), 47-49. This includes a reference to ′Ātānati the much renowned’, and ‘the heart of Ātānāti furthering all acts ...′ as if this were a person, though according to our text and DA, Ātānātā is a town.</div>
<div class="bmtx">This Sutta is much used on special occasions in the countries of Theravāda Buddhism. Thus in Thailand it is chanted at the New Year, together with the Mahāsamaya Sutta (DN 20, with which it has much in common) and the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta (SN 56.12.2, the Buddha’s first sermon). The Thai version also includes a non-canonical introductory portion containing verses of homage to twenty-one Buddhas earlier  than Vipassi, going right back to Dipankara, under whom the future Buddha Gotama first went forth, and to three even earlier Buddhas before him.

<div class="end"><a id="calibre_link-1496" href="#calibre_link-1359" class="calibre4">1012</a>   This is undoubtedly a late Sutta. RD with characteristic caution says of this and DN 34: ‘They contain here and there matter which suggests that they took their present shape at a later date than the bulk of the rest of the Digha’. It is associated, like DN 29, with the time immediately following the death of the Nigantha Nātaputta, the Jain leader, and it is located ‘in the mango-grove of Cunda the smith’, known to us from DN 16.4.14ff. If we compare DN 29, we find that that discourse is addressed to ‘the novice Cunda’, who is quite a different character &mdash; but we may wonder whether the two have not become confused. Part of the inspiration of DN 34 may have come from the Buddha’s words at DN 29.17. Could the whole Sutta have been expanded from that nucleus? In any case the method of listing items in expanding numerical groups was used (whether earlier or later) on a large scale in the Anguttara Nikaya, and in fact quite a number of entries in the lists in this Sutta  appear there too.<div class="bmtx">Such numerical listing has also been compared by different writers from RD onwards to the so-called ‘matrices’  <i class="calibre9">(mātikā)</i> of the Abhidhamma &mdash; partly with the implication that this type of presentation always represents a stratum considerably later than the Buddha’s time. In fact we do not know to what extent the Buddha himself resorted to the obvious pedagogic device of teaching ‘by numbers’. In any case, when such numerical lists were in existence, they readily lent themselves to expansion, and it is likely that the material of this Sutta dates from a variety of periods, and because some of it is obviously late, this does not mean that other parts are not early. There are in existence Tibetan and other versions. It should perhaps be stressed that, arid as this type of Sutta may appear to many today, it is from the monastic point of view valuable for use in chanting (its ostensible - and probably real &mdash; original object), incorporating as it does not only the major doctrinal categories in brief, but many points on behaviour and discipline which monks should constantly bear in mind.</div>
