3 THE RHINOCEROS HORN (KHAGGAVISĀṆA SUTTA)

Having put down the rod toward all beings,
not harming a single one among them,
one should not desire a son, how then a companion?
One should live alone like a rhinoceros horn.

For one who has formed bonds, there is affection,
following on affection, this suffering arises.
Discerning the danger born of affection,


Sympathizing with friends dear to one’s heart,
with mind attached, one forsakes the good.
Seeing this peril in intimacy,


As widespread bamboo becomes entwined,
just so is concern for wives and sons.
But like a bamboo shoot, not getting stuck,


As a deer unbound in the forest
goes off to graze wherever it wants,
so a wise person, looking out for freedom,


One is addressed in the midst of companions,
whether resting, standing, going, or traveling.
Looking out for the freedom that is not coveted,


There is play and delight in the midst of companions,
and affection for one’s sons is vast.
Averse to separation from those who are dear,


At home in the four directions, unrepelled,
contented with anything whatsoever,
enduring obstacles, fearless,


Even some monastics are hard to please;
so, too, householders living at home.
Being unconcerned about others’ sons,


Having discarded the marks of a layman
like a koviḷāra tree whose leaves are shed,
having cut off a layman’s bonds, the hero


If one should find a judicious companion,
a fellow wanderer, of good behavior, resolute,
having overcome all obstacles, one should
live with him, satisfied and mindful.

But if one does not find a judicious companion,
a fellow wanderer, of good behavior, resolute,
like a king who has abandoned a conquered realm,


Surely, we praise the excellence of companionship:
one should resort to companions one’s equal or better.
Not obtaining these, as one who eats blamelessly


Having seen radiant [bracelets] of gold,
skillfully fashioned by a goldsmith,
clashing together in pairs on the arm,


Thus if I had a partner, I would incur
[fond] words of address or verbal friction.
Looking out for this peril in the future,


Sensual pleasures are colorful, sweet, delightful,
but in their diversity they agitate the mind.
Having seen danger in the strands of sensual pleasure,


“This is adversity, a boil, disaster,
an illness, a dart, and peril for me”:
having seen this peril in the strands of sensual pleasure,


Cold and heat, hunger, thirst,
wind, the hot sun, gadflies, and serpents:
having patiently endured all these,


As an elephant that has abandoned the herd —
with massive back, lotus-like, eminent —
may live in the forest as he pleases,


It is impossible that one who delights in company
might attain even temporary liberation.
Having attended to the word of the Kinsman of the Sun,


“I have transcended the contortions of views,
reached the fixed course, obtained the path.
I have aroused knowledge, I’m not to be led by others”:


Without greed, without scheming, without thirst,
not denigrating, with stains and delusion blown away,
without wishes for anything in all the world,


One should avoid an evil companion,
who shows what is harmful, one settled in unrighteousness.
One should not freely associate with one who is intent and heedless;


One should resort to the learned, a bearer of Dhamma,
an eminent friend gifted with ingenuity.
Having known the benefits and removed doubt,


Having found no satisfaction in the world
with play, delight, and sensual pleasures, not taking any interest in them,
refraining from ornaments, a speaker of truth,


Having abandoned children and wife,
father and mother, wealth, grain, and relatives,
sensual pleasures according to the limit,


“This is a tie, the happiness here is slight,
giving little gratification; the suffering here is more,
this is a hook”: having known thus, a thoughtful person


Having sundered the fetters,
like a fish in the water that has broken a net,
like a fire not returning to what has been burnt,


With downcast gaze, not footloose,
with guarded faculties, with protected mind,
unpolluted, not feverish with passion,


Having cast off the marks of a layman
like a pāricchattaka tree that has shed its leaves,
clothed in ochre robes, having renounced,


Not arousing greed for tastes, not hankering for them;
not nourishing others, walking for alms without skipping houses;
with a mind unbound to this or that family,


Having abandoned the five obstructions of mind,
having dispelled all mental defilements,
independent, having cut off affection and hatred,


Having left behind pleasure and pain
and previously [discarded] joy and dejection,
having gained purified equanimity and serenity,


With energy aroused to attain the supreme goal,
with unsluggish mind and robust practice,
firmly persistent, equipped with strength and power,


Not neglecting seclusion and jhāna,
always acting in accordance with the teachings,
having explored the danger in states of existence,


Yearning for craving’s destruction, heedful,
intelligent, learned, mindful,
having comprehended the Dhamma, fixed in destiny, vigorous in striving,


Like a lion unalarmed among sounds,
like the wind not caught in a net,
untainted like a lotus by water,


Like the lion, king of beasts, who has fangs as its strength,
who lives by attacking and overpowering,
one should resort to remote lodgings;


At the right time pursuing liberation by loving-kindness,
equanimity, compassion, and altruistic joy,
not antagonized by the whole world,


Having abandoned lust, hatred, and delusion,
having sundered the fetters [that keep one bound],
not terrified at the extinction of life,


They resort to you and serve you for a motive;
friends without motive are today very rare.
Impure people are wise about their own good:
