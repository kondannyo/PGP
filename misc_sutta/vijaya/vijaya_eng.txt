11 VICTORY (VIJAYA SUTTA)94

193. When one is walking or standing,
sitting or lying down,
when one bends and stretches —
this is the motion of the body. (1)

194. Bound together by bones and sinews,
plastered with skin and flesh,
covered by the epidermis,
the body is not seen as it really is — (2)

195. as filled with intestines,
filled with the stomach,
with the liver and bladder,
the heart, lungs, kidneys, and spleen; (3)

196. with snot and saliva,
with sweat and fat,
with blood and oil of the joints,
with bile and grease. (4)

197. Further, from its nine openings
impurity flows constantly:
muck from the eyes,
wax from the ears, (5)

198. snot from the nostrils;
and from the mouth one sometimes
vomits bile and vomits phlegm;
sweat and dirt flow from the body. (6)

199. Then its hollow head
is filled with the brain.
Led on by ignorance, the fool
conceives it as beautiful. (7)

200. And when it is lying dead,
bloated and discolored,
cast off in a charnel ground,
the relatives are unconcerned with it. (8)

201. Dogs then devour it,
as do jackals, wolves, and worms;
crows and vultures devour it,
and whatever other beings there are. (9) [35]

202. Having heard the Word of the Buddha,
a bhikkhu possessing wisdom here
fully understands it,
because he sees it as it really is: (10)

203. “As this, so that;
as that, so this”:
internally and externally
one should expunge desire for the body. (11)

204. That bhikkhu possessing wisdom here
who has expunged desire and lust
has attained the deathless, peace,
the imperishable state of nibbāna. (12)

205. This two-footed body,
impure and foul-smelling, is cherished,
though filled with various kinds of filth
and oozing here and there. (13)

206. One who, because of such a body,
would think to exalt himself
or who would disparage others —
what is this due to but lack of vision? (14)
