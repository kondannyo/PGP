    This verse contains three syntactically separate sentences. They are:
    1) pubbaj ce puriso kayira kayira naj punappunaj (should a person do good,

    b) kayira naj punappunaj (let him do it again and again). The subject is
omitted; the word puriso from the first sentence is implied. The verb is kayira
(should do, 3rd person, singular, active, optative). The adverb punappunaj
(again and again) forms an attribute to the verb. The object is the pronoun naj
(it, accusative singular).
    2) tamhi chandaj kayiratha (one should wish for it, lit.: one should make a
wish in it). As above, the subject is omitted, implying the noun puriso from
the first sentence. The verb is kayiratha (should do, 3rd person, singular,
medium, optative). The object is the noun chandaj (wish, accusative singular)
with its attribute, the pronoun tamhi (in it, locative singular).
    3) sukho pubbassa uccayo (accumulation of good is pleasant). The subject is
the noun uccayo (accumulation, nominative singular). It has an attribute, the
noun pubbassa (of good, genitive singular). The object is the adjective sukho
(pleasant, nominative singular). The verb is omitted, implying the verb "to
be".

Commentary:
    Venerable Mahakassapa once stayed in a cave, practicing meditation for
seven days. When he arose from his meditation he wanted to give somebody a
chance to gain merit by offering him food. He saw a young girl cooking meal. So
he stood by her door looking for almsfood. She saw him and happily offered him
some food, wishing that the merit gained offering might help her to realize the
truth.
    After some time she was bitten by a snake and died. She was reborn as a
goddess in Tavatimsa heaven.
    She understood that she was reborn there only because of the merit gained
by offering almsfood to Kassapa. She wished to continue doing good deeds. So
every morning she would come to the monastery, sweep the floor and fill the
water-pots. At first Kassapa thought that some diligent young novice was doing
this service, but later he found out that a goddess performed them all. He
advised her not to come to the monastery too often, because people might start
talking, if they saw her often there. She was quite upset and begged him not to
destroy her chances for gaining more merit.
    The Buddha heard her and supported Kassapa's opinion. He told her that
although performing good deeds was very pleasant, she should not continue
coming to the monastery every day.
