    In the first sentence (the first line) the subject is omitted. A third
person singular pronoun is meant. The verb is the optative kāyirā (can do, 3rd
person, singular, active, optative). The verb has an attribute, the compound
puppharāsimhā (from the heap of flowers, ablative singular). The object is the
noun mālāguṇe (garlands, accusative plural). It has an attribute, the adjective
bahū (many, accusative plural). The relative adverb yathā (just as), which
forms quite a common phrase yathā pi(same meaning) with the conjunction pi
(also), connects this sentence to the next one.
    The second sentence (second line) is passive. The subject is the word
maccena (by a mortal, instrumental singular) with an attribute, the past
participle jātena (by a born, instrumental singular). The verb is in the
gerund, kattabbaṃ (should be done, nominative singular). The object is the noun
kusalaṃ (merit, nominative singular) with the adjective bahuṃ (nominative
singular) as an attribute.

Commentary:
    The traditional commentary for this verse contains the famous story of the
chief Buddha's benefactress Visākhā.
    She married Punnavaddhana, the son of Migāra, a rich man who lived in the
city of Sāvatthi. Once, when her father-in-law was eating his lunch, a monk
came to their house on his alms-round. Migāra ignored him completely. Visākhā
told the monk: "Sorry, venerable sir, my father-in-law only eats stale food".
Migāra became very angry with her. She explained, that he was only reaping
rewards of his good deeds from previous lives, not creating any merit in this
life. Therefore she spoke about "stale food".
    Migāra understood and allowed her to invite the Buddha with the monks for
the alms-food. Migāra listened to Buddha's discourse from behind a curtain
(because he was a lay disciple of some ascetic teacher and he did not want
Migāra to show himself in front of the Buddha). After hearing Buddha's speech,
Migāra attained the first stage of Awakenment. He was very grateful to Visākhā
and declared that she would be like a mother to him.
    Once she went to the monastery and carried her gem-entrusted cloak with
her. She gave it to her maid to carry and she forgot it in the monastery.
Visākhā then wanted to donate the cloak to the monks but they would not accept.
So Visākhā tried to sell the cloak and donate the money for the use of the
Sangha. But the cloak was so expensive that nobody could afford to buy it.
Visākhā then bought it back herself. With the money she built a monastery for
the Sangha.
    Visākhā was very happy - all her desires were fulfilled. The Buddha
explained that she was strongly inclined to do good deeds, had done much good
in the past and will do a lot of good deeds in the future - just as one can do
many garlands from the heap of flowers.
