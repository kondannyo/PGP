Commentary:
    A householder named Citta once met Venerable Mahānāma, one of the first
Buddha's disciples. When listening to the discourse given by him, Citta
realized the Dharma. Therefore, he built a monastery in his mango grove and
installed a monk named Sudhamma as the resident monk.
    On day, Venerable Moggallāna and Venerable Sāriputta came to the monastery.
They gave a discourse and after hearing it, Citta attained the third stage of
Awakenment. He then invited Moggallāna and Sāriputta to his house for alms food
the next day. After that he also invited Sudhamma, but he refused, saying that
he was invited only after the other two were. Citta repeated his invitation,
but Sudhamma again turned it down.
    But the next day Sudhamma came to the Citta's house nevertheless. He was
invited inside, but he refused, saying that he was on his alms round. But when
he saw tasty food being prepared for Moggallāna and Sāriputta he got envious
and angry. He told Citta that he did not want to live in his monastery any
longer.
    Sudhamma then reported to the Buddha what happened. The Buddha told him,
"You have offended a faithful and generous lay disciple. You must go back and
apologize for your mistake!" Sudhamma did so, but Citta felt that he still did
not realize his mistake fully and refused his apology. Sudhamma went back to
the Buddha, who admonished him with this verse (and the following one, see DhP
74). He said, "You should not be attached to this or that dwelling, to this or
that lay disciple - in this way the pride and envy will increase."
    Sudhamma went back to the Citta's house and this time Citta accepted the
apology. Not long after that, Sudhamma attained Arahantship.
