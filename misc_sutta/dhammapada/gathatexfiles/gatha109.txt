Commentary:
    Once there were two ascetics living together and practicing austerities.
Later one of them returned to the lay life and got married. When a son was born
to him and his wife, they took the boy to see the other ascetic. He said, "May
you live long!" to the parents, but he said nothing to the child. The parents
were surprised and asked him why did he do that. The ascetic said that he could
see with his powers that the boy would die after seven more days. He sent them
to see the Buddha, who could know how to prevent his death.
    When they got to the presence of the Buddha, he again said, "May you live
long!" only to the parents and nothing to their son. In order to prevent his
death, he told his parents to build a pavilion at their house and put the child
on a couch inside it. He then sent some monks over to chant texts for
protection. Many gods and other celestial beings came to the pavilion and were
in attendance. On the seventh day, the Buddha himself arrived. Then an evil
demon came to the pavilion and stood by the entrance. He waited for an
opportunity to attack the boy. But as there were so many powerful beings
around, he could not get near him. The chanting continued through the whole
night, and in the morning the demon had to leave. The young child was saved. He
then paid his respects to the Buddha who then told him, "May you live long!"
The Buddha then told the parents that their child would live a very long life.
    Many years passed and the boy grew up. Once he came to see the Buddha and
asked him how to gain longevity. The Buddha replied with this verse, saying
that those who respect people of virtuous character and who pay homage to those
worth paying homage, not only will gain longevity, but also beauty, happiness
and strength.
