Commentary:
    The Buddha once stayed in Alavi and spoke to its people about the
impermanence of life. He told them to be aware of death and to reflect that
their life is uncertain. He added that they should practice mindfulness as a
weapon against the death. Many people did not really understand what he was
talking about, but some did. Amongst them there was a young girl, who was a
weaver by profession.
    Later the Buddha returned to Alavi. The girl wanted to hear his discourse,
but her father asked her to wind some thread spools and bring them to him. She
did the job quickly and on the way to her father she stopped by the place where
the Buddha was talking and listened.
    The Buddha knew that the girl was ready to reach the first stage of
Awakenment and so he looked at her directly. The girl approached respectfully.
The Buddha then asked her four questions and she replied as follows:
"Where have you come from?" "I don't know."
"Where are you going?" "I don't know."
"Don't you know?" "Yes, I know."
"Do you know?" "I don't know."
    Many people thought her answers were disrespectful, but the girl explained.
By the first question the Buddha meant if she knew what was her previous
existence. She replied that she did not know. The second question meant if she
knew what would be her future existence. Since she did not know, she said so.
The third question meant if she did not know that she would die one day. She
replied she knew. And the last question meant if she knew when exactly would
she die. She did not know and replied truthfully.
    The Buddha applauded her and delivered a discourse. The girl attained the
first stage of Awakenment.
    Then she continued to her father. He was asleep and she woke him up. When
he was waking up, her father accidentally pulled the shuttle and the sharp
point hit the girl in her chest. She died instantly and was reborn in the
Tusita heaven. Her father, full of remorse and broken-hearted went to the
Buddha and asked to be admitted into the Order as a monk. The Buddha granted
him permission and the man attained Arahantship soon.
