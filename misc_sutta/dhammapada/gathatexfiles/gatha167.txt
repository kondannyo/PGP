Commentary:
    Visakha was a very famous benefactress of the Buddhist Community from
Savatthi. Once an older monks with his young pupil came to her house for
almsfood. Visakha's granddaughter was filtering water for the young monk and
when she saw her reflection on the surface of the water, she laughed. The young
monk also laughed. The girl got angry and said, "You shaven head, why do you
laugh at me?!" The monk did not like it and replied, "You and your family are
shaven heads yourself!" The girl went weeping to Visakha. Visakha tried to
appease both the girl and the monk but the monk was angry and did not accept
her explanations and apologies. The older monk also tried his best but did not
succeed either.
    The matter was brought to the Buddha, who saw that the monk was ready to
reach the first stage of Awakenment. So he asked Visakha, "Why did your
granddaughter had to address my monk as a shaven head? All the monks had to
shave their heads when they became members of the Community!" The young monk
felt very happy and praised the Buddha that he was the only one who could
understand him. The Buddha then replied with this verse, saying that the monk
was also to blame; he should not quarrel because of such a small and
unimportant thing. Hearing that, the young monk reached the first stage of
Awakenment.
