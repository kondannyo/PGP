    This verse contains two sentences. First is dūraṅgamaṃ ekacaraṃ asarīraṃ
guhāsayaṃ ye cittaṃ saṃyamissanti (Those, who can restrain the mind, which is
going far, wandering alone, bodiless and living in the cave). Here, the subject
is the relative pronoun ye (those, who; nominative plural). The verb is
saṃyamissanti (will restrain, 3rd person, plural, active, future tense). The
object is the word cittaṃ (mind, accusative singular) with its four attributes.
They are: 1) dūraṅgamaṃ (going far), 2) ekacaraṃ (wandering alone), 3) asarīraṃ
(bodiless), 4) guhāsayaṃ (living in the cave). They all have to agree with the
object and are therefore in accusative singular.
    The rest of the verse forms the second sentence: mokkhanti mārabandhanā (
[they] will be freed from the bond of Mara). The subject is missing here, we
have to supply a personal pronoun te (they, nominative plural), that should
form the second part of the paradigm relative pronoun - personal pronoun (ye -
te). The verb is mokkhanti (will be freed, 3rd person, plural, passive, future
tense). The object is mārabandhanā (from the bond of Mara, ablative singular).

Commentary:
    Saṅgharakkhita Thera was from the city of Sāvatthi. His sister gave birth
to a son. People called him "The nephew Saṅgharakkhita". He also became a monk.

    Once he was offered two sets of robes. He wanted to give one set to his
uncle. So at the end of the retreat he went to see him, but his uncle did not
want a robe, saying he had enough. The young man felt bad, thinking the uncle
does not want to share with him. So he decided to leave the Order.
    His mind began to wander and a train of thoughts appeared. When he became a
layman he would sell his robes and buy a goat. The goat would breed quickly and
soon he would have enough money to marry. His wife would give birth to a son.
He would take his wife and son in a cart to see the uncle. On the way he would
say he could carry the child. She would tell him to drive that she could carry
the baby. But he will insist and grab the child. The child would fall down and
the wheel would pass over him. He would get furious and hit his wife with the
goading stick.
    At that time he was fanning the Thera and absentmindedly hit him with the
fan. His uncle said: "You were unable to beat your wife, why hit an old monk?"
The young man was embarrassed and frightened of his uncle, so he fled. The
monks chased him and took him to see the Buddha. He told him the verse and said
that the mind has ability to think of objects far away and that one should
strive for liberation. The young monk attained the first stage of awakenment.
