    This verse consists of two related sentences. They are:
    1) ye jhanapasuta dhira nekkhammupasame rata (the wise ones, who are intent
upon meditation, delighting in renunciation and calm). The subject is the noun
dhira (wise ones, nominative plural). It has two attributes, the compound
jhanapasuta (intent upon meditation, nominative plural) and the past participle
rata (delighting in, nominative plural). This last word has its own attribute,
the compound nekkhammupasame (in renunciation and calm, locative singular). the
verb is omitted, implying the verb "to be". The relative adverb ye (those, who;
nominative plural) introduces the sentence and connects it to the following
one.
    2) deva pi tesaj pihayanti sambuddhanaj satimataj (even the gods do envy
them, [those] completely awakened and wakeful ones). The subject is the noun
deva (gods, nominative plural). It is modified by the particle pi (even). The
verb is pihayanti (envy, 3rd person, plural, active, indicative, present
tense). The object is the pronoun tesaj (them, genitive plural) with its two
attributes, the adjectives sambuddhanaj (completely awakened ones, genitive
plural) and satimataj (wakeful ones, genitive plural).

Commentary:
    Once, when the Buddha was staying in Savatthi, he was challenged by some
other ascetics to perform a miracle. He therefore performed the Twin Miracle
and proceeded to the Tavatimsa heaven to teach Abhidharma there. His mother had
been reborn in the Tusita heaven, but went to Tavatimsa to learn the Teaching.
After hearing the Dharma from the Buddha, his mother together with many other
gods reached the first level of Awakenment.
    The Buddha spent three months in Tavatimsa. Venerable Sariputta was
spending the Rain Retreat in Samkassa and taught the Abhidharma, as the Buddha
instructed him. At the end of the Retreat Venerable Moggallana went to
Tavatimsa to see the Buddha and was informed that the Buddha would be coming
back to Samkassa on the fool moon day at the end of the Rain Retreat.
    On that day the Buddha appeared, six colored rays shining from his body. A
great number of gods accompanied him and paid his homage to him before they
left. Sariputta exclaimed how magnificent the gods looked and how extraordinary
that both human beings and gods respect the Buddha so much.
    The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that indeed even the gods envy a
buddha his qualities.
