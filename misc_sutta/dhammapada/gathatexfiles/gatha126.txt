Commentary:
    In the city of Sāvatthi once lived a gem polisher. He has been giving
almsfood to a certain monk for the last twelve years. One day, the gem polisher
was carrying a piece of meat when a messenger for the king arrived, giving him
a piece of gem that the king wanted to be cut and polished. The gem polisher
took the gem with his hands bloody from the meat, put it on the table and went
to wash his hands.
    The family had a pet bird. When it saw the gem covered with blood, it took
it for a piece of meat and ate it. When the gem polisher returned, he did not
see the gem anywhere. He asked everybody, but nobody knew anything. At the end
he also asked the monk, who was also present. The monk replied that he did not
take the gem.
    The gem polisher was convinced, that the monk was lying and decided to
inflict torture on him. Even though his wife discouraged him from this action,
saying that this monk was an Arahant and their teacher for so many years, the
gem polisher paid no attention. He tied the monk up and beat him with a stick.
    The monk started to bleed all over his body and the bird came over again,
drawn by the blood. The gem polisher was angry and kicked the bird, killing it
instantly. Only then did the monk reveal that the bird ate the gem. The gem
polisher cut the bird open and indeed found the gem inside.
    Immediately he untied the monk and asked for forgiveness. The monk replied
that he feels no hatred towards him and even agreed to continue coming to his
house for almsfood. Only after this he would not enter the house - just stay by
the door.
    Soon after, the monk died from his injuries and reached the final Nirvana.
The bird was born as the gem polisher's son. When the gem polisher died he was
born in hell and his wife in heaven, because she spoke against beating of the
innocent monk.
