Commentary:
    A certain man from Sāvatthi was once looking for his ox lost in the forest.
He got hungry so he went to a village monastery, where the monks gave him the
remains of the morning meal. While eating, he realized that he was working hard
every day, but did not even have enough food. What if he became a monk? So he
asked the monks to grant him an ordination. As a monk he had plenty of food,
soon he was quite fat.
    After some time he grew tired of going for alms and so he decided to become
a layman again. Later he again changed his mind, thinking the life too
strenuous and became a monk. In this way he left the Order and came back six
times.
    While he was going back and forth, his wife became pregnant. Once he
entered their bedroom when she was asleep. She was almost naked, snoring
loudly, saliva trickling down the mouth. This and her bloated stomach made her
look like a corpse. He was able to perceive impermanence and unpleasantness of
the body. He was thinking that he was a monk for several times and only because
of this woman he was not able to stay. So he left home for seventh time,
repeating as he went the words "impermanence" and "suffering" and on the way to
the monastery he attained the first stage of awakenment. But the monks did not
want to permit him into the Order, joking: "You have been shaving your head so
often, that it looks like a whetting stone." He asked once more and the monks
granted him the ordination one last time. Within few days he attained
arahantship.
    The monks were surprised to see him staying so long, so they asked what
happened. The man said he had no attachments any more, so why would he leave.
But they did not believe him and asked the Buddha, who said it was the truth.
The man was an arahant now, who discarded both the ideas of good and evil.
