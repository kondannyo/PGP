Commentary:
    Anatha Pindika and Ugga both studied under the same teacher while they were
young. Later Anatha Pindika had a daughter and Ugga had a son. When the
children grew up, their parents arranged their marriage. The daughter of Anatha
Pindika, named Cula Subhadda went to live with her husband and parents-in-law.
    Ugga and his family were not followers of the Buddha, but they were
disciples of different ascetic school (called "naked ascetics", because the
monks did not wear any clothes). Cula Subhadda told her mother-in-law about the
Buddha and she was anxious to see him. She agreed to invite the Buddha for the
almsfood the next day. Because the Jetavana monastery was far away, Cula
Subhadda made the invitation only with her heart. But the Buddha knew and
accepted the invitation.
    At that day, Anatha Pindika went to the monastery and invited the Buddha to
have almsfood in his house the next day. But the Buddha replied that he had
already accepted Cula Subhadda's invitation. Anatha Pindika asked how was it
possible if his daughter lived so far away. The Buddha replied with this verse,
saying that the good ones can be seen and heard from far away.
    The next day, the Buddha with many monks went to the house of Ugga. After
the meal, he delivered a discourse. The whole Ugga's family became followers of
the Buddha.
