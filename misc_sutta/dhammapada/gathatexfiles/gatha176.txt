Commentary:
    The Buddha did not have only admirers and devotees. Some other teachers
hated him for being so famous and for taking many disciples away from them. One
such teacher instigated a beautiful young girl, a pupil of his, to ruin the
Buddha's fame.
    The girl, named Cibca Manavika, would go towards the Jetavana monastery in
the evening and return early in the morning, claiming she spent the night with
the Buddha. After several months of this behavior, she started wrapping cloth
around her stomach. She added more and more cloth to create an impression she
was pregnant. Finally she went to the monastery to confront the Buddha. She
accused him of making her pregnant and not caring about her. The Buddha told
her not to lie, but she would just repeat her statements.
    Just then Sakka, the king of gods, sent some rats to bit off the strings of
the cloth the girl had wrapped around her body. It fell off and her deceit was
uncovered. People started to reprimand her and she ran away in shame. Later she
died due to an accident.
    The next day some monks were discussing this story and the Buddha replied
them with this verse, saying that lying is the first step towards all kinds of
evil deeds.
    He also told them, that Cibca Manavika was a king's consort in one of her
previous lives. She fell in love with a crown prince, but the young man did not
respond to her love. She harmed herself and accused the prince of making
advances to her and when she refused, he harmed her. The king was very angry
and exiled his son immediately. Later he found out the truth and punished the
evil woman.
