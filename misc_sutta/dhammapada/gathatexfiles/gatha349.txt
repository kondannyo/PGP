Commentary:
    A young monk once asked for some water in a house where a young woman lived
alone. She fell in love with him immediately and invited him to come over for
almsfood anytime he wanted. Later she would hint that she had enough money but
felt very lonely. The monk felt himself attracted to her and began
contemplating leaving the Order and marrying her. He became thin and nervous
because of his thoughts and the matter was reported to the Buddha.
    The Buddha told the monk that in his previous life this woman was his wife.
Once they were traveling and met some thieves. She fell in love with their
leader and helped him kill her husband. Just like in the previous life she was
the source of his death, so in this life she could well be the ruin of his life
as a monk. The Buddha then spoke this verse (and the following one, DhP 350).
    The monk took the advice to his heart and began striving diligently towards
the Awakenment.
