    This verse consists of three syntactically separated sentences.
    The first sentence is dīghā jāgarato ratti (long is the night for a
wakeful). Here, the subject is the word ratti (night, nominative singular). It
has the adjective dīghā (long, nominative singular) as an attribute. The verb
is omitted, implying the verb "to be". The object is the active present
participle jāgarato (for the wakeful, genitive singular).
    The second sentence is dīghaṃ santassa yojanaṃ (long is a yojana for a
tired). The subject is the word yojanaṃ(yojana, nominative singular) with the
adjective dīghaṃ (long, nominative singular) as an attribute. The verb is again
omitted, as before implying the verb "to be". The object is the past participle
santassa (for a tired, genitive singular).
    The third sentence is dīgho bālānaṃ saṃsāro saddhammaṃ avijānataṃ (long is
the samsara for the fools who do not know the true Dharma). The subject is the
noun saṃsāro (samsara, nominative singular) with an attribute, the adjective
dīgho (long, nominative singular). As before, the verb is "to be", therefore it
is not really needed and is omitted. The object is the noun bālānaṃ (for the
fools, genitive plural). It has an attribute, the active present participle
avijānataṃ (for the not knowing, genitive plural). This word has itself an
attribute, the noun saddhammaṃ (the true Dharma, accusative singular).

Commentary:
    King Pasenadi of Kosala once saw a beautiful woman in the city. He
instantly fell in love with her. He found out that she was already married and
so he gave her husband a job in the palace. Then the king sent the young man on
an impossible mission. He told him to collect some lotus flowers and red earth
from the underground world and to return to the city the same day. He thought
of course that the man will never complete the task and so will never dare to
come back. Thus the king could take the wife to himself.
    The young man set out on his mission. On the way he shared his food with
some traveler. Then he threw the rest of the food to the river and called the
guardian spirits, telling them that he shares with them his merit obtained from
sharing the food with others. The guardian spirit of the river then brought him
the flowers and earth from the underworld.
    The young man returned to the city only to find the gates closed. The king
had the city gates closed early in fear that the man will complete the task in
time. So he put the flowers and earth on the ground, declared loudly that his
mission is complete and went for the night to the monastery of Jetavana.
    The king was obsessed with his desire for the young woman, so he could not
sleep that night. He heard some strange sounds. In the morning he went to see
the Buddha about them. The Buddha told him that the sounds he heard came from
the men who desired others' wives and now suffer in hell.
    The king realized foolishness of his actions and reflected that now he
knows how long is the night for the sleepless. Also the young man realized how
long is the journey for one who is tired.
    The Buddha told them by this verse that longest is the Samsara for those
who are foolish and do not know the Dharma.
