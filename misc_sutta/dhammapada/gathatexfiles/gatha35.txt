Vocabulary and Grammar:

List of Abbreviations
dunniggahassa: dunniggaha-, Adj.: difficult to restrain. The word niggaha-,
N.m.: restraining is derived from the verb root gah- (to hold) with the prefix
ni- (down). The word is transformed to and adjective by the prefix du-
(difficult, bad). The doublen is due to the euphonic combination (du + niggaha
= dunniggaha). Gen.Sg.n. = dunniggahassa.
lahuno: lahu-, Adj.: light, quick. Gen.Sg.n. = lahuno.
yatthakāmanipātino: yatthakāmanipātin-, Adj: jumping at whatever it desires. It
is a complex compound of:
    yatthakāmaṃ, Adv.: according to one's desire. The disappearance of the
final -ṃ is only
    an omission, perhaps due to the metrical requirements. It can be further
analyzed as:
        yattha, Rel.Adv.: where.
        kāma-, N.m.: desire, pleasure.
    nipātin-, Adj.: falling down, chancing upon. It is derived (by the way of
adding
    the possessive suffix -in) from the verb root pat- (fall) with the prefix
ni- (down).
Gen.Sg.n. = yatthakāmanipātino.
List of Abbreviations
cittassa: citta-, N.n.: mind. Gen.Sg. = cittassa.
damatho: damatha-, N.m.: taming, subduing, restraint, control. Derived from the
verb dam- (to restrain, to control, to tame). Nom.Sg. = damatho.
sādhu, Adv.: good, well.
cittaṃ: citta-, N.n.: mind (see also above). Nom.Sg. = cittaṃ.
List of Abbreviations
dantaṃ: danta-, Adj.: restrained, tamed, controlled. It is a p.p. of the verb
dam-(to restrain, to control, to tame). Nom.Sg.n. = dantaṃ.
sukhāvahaṃ: sukhāvaha-, Adj.: bringing happiness. A compound of:
    sukha-, N.n.: happiness.
    āvaha-, Adj.: bringing, causing. Derived from the verb root vah- (to carry)
with
    the prefix ā- (towards, to).
Nom.Sg.n. = sukhāvahaṃ.
List of Abbreviations
    This verse consists of two grammatically separated sentences. One is:
dunniggahassa lahuno yatthakāmanipātino cittassa damatho sādhu (good is the
taming of the mind, which is difficult to restrain, quick, jumping at whatever
it desires). Here the subject is damatho (taming, nominative singular). The
verb is omitted, therefore we have to supply the verb "to be". An attribute to
this verb is the adverb sādhu (well). The object is the word cittassa (of the
mind, genitive singular). It has three attributes; 1) dunniggahassa (of the
difficult to restrain one), 2) lahuno (of the quick one), 3) yatthakāmanipātino
(of the jumping-at-whatever-it-desires one). They all have to agree with the
object and are therefore in genitive singular.
    The second sentence is cittaṃ dantaṃ sukhāvahaṃ (restrained mind brings
happiness). Here the subject is the word cittaṃ (mind, nominative singular). It
has an attribute, the past participle dantaṃ(restrained, nominative singular).
The verb is again omitted, the verb "to be" again being implied. The word
sukhāvahaṃ (happiness-bringing, nominative singular) forms an attribute to this
verb.

Commentary:
    Sixty monks received their meditation subjects from the Buddha and they
went to the village of Mātika. There the mother of the village headman, called
Mātikamātā, built a monastery for them and gave them alms food regularly. So
they decided to spend the Rain Retreat there. She asked them to teach her some
Dharma and they taught her the 32 body parts and awareness of the body's decay.
She practiced diligently and attained the third (last but one) stage of
awakenment. She also attained some supernormal powers; she was able to read
other people's minds. She used this power and saw that the sixty monks have not
so far attained anything. She saw, that they all had potential for arahantship,
but they needed proper food. So she gave them alms food and soon they all
became arahants.
    At the end of the retreat they went back to the Buddha and reported what
happened. A certain monk decided to go to the same village. Mātikamātā
personally came to the monastery and gave him alms food. He asked her about her
supernormal powers, but she evaded this subject. He got scared that she will
see his impure mind and left the village.
    He told the Buddha about his fears, but the Buddha sent him back, telling
him to control his mind under all circumstances. So the monk went back,
thinking only about his meditation subject. Mātikamātā made sure that he had
enough alms food and the monk too attained arahantship soon.
