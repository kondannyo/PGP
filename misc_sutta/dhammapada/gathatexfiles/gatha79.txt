Vocabulary and Grammar:

List of Abbreviations
dhammapīti: dhammapītin-, Adj.m.: drinking the Dharma. It is a compound of:
    dhamma-, N.m.: Buddha's Teaching. The Law. Derived from the verb dha-, to
hold.
    Thus dhamma "holds the world together".
    pītin-, Adj.: drinking. It is derived (by adding the possessive suffix -in)
from the word
    pīta-, Adj.: having drunk, which is a p.p. of the verb pā-(to drink).
Nom.Sg. = dhammapītī, the form dhammapīticould be due to the metrical
requirements.
This is the traditional explanation of this word. There is, however, another
possibility, taking the word pītias pīti-, N.f.: joy, delight. The meaning of
the whole compound then would be "one who finds joy in the Dharma". In the
light of the second line of this verse, where the verb ramati is used, I find
this more convincing. In the translation of this verse this meaning is used,
however here in the Vocabulary I introduced the traditional meaning first. Also
in the Commentary, which is also traditional, this meaning is worked with. In
the Sentence Structure, this second meaning is used - at the end of the
compound then N.f. becomes N.m.
sukhaṃ, Adv.: happily. It is the word sukha-, N.n.: happiness. Acc.Sg. =sukhaṃ.
Here as an adverb.
List of Abbreviations
seti, V.: lays, dwells. The verb root is si- (to lay). 3.Sg.act.in.pres. =
seti.
vippasannena:vippasanna-, Adj.: purified, clear, bright. It is a p.p. of the
verb vippasīdati (to become bright). The verb root is sīd- (to sit). Ins.Sg.n.
= vippasannena.
cetasā: ceto-, N.n.: mind. Ins.Sg. = cetasā.
ariyappavedite: ariyappavedita-, Adj.: declared by the noble ones. It is a
compound of:
    ariya-, Adj.: noble, distinguished, good.
    pavedita-, Adj.: declared, made known, taught. It is a p.p. of the verb
pavedati (to make known).
Euphonic combination: ariya- + pavedita- = ariyappavedita-.
Loc.Sg.m. = ariyappavedite.
List of Abbreviations
dhamme: dhamma-, N.m: see above. Loc.Sg. = dhamme.
sadā, Adv.: always.
ramati, V.: delights. The verb root is ram- (to enjoy, to delight in).
3.Sg.act.in.pres. = ramati.
paṇḍito: N.m.: wise man, learned man. Nom.Sg. = paṇḍito.
List of Abbreviations
    This verse consists of two sentences. They form the first and second line
respectively.
    In the first sentence (first line), the subject is the compound dhammapīti
(one who finds joy in the Dharma; or one who drinks the Dharma, nominative
singular). The verb is seti (dwells, 3rd person, singular, active, indicative,
present tense). This verb has two attributes, the adverb sukhaṃ (happily) and
the noun cetasā(with a mind, instrumental singular). This word has its own
attribute, the past participle vippasannena (with bright, instrumental
singular).
    In the second sentence (second line), the subject is the noun paṇḍito (wise
man, nominative singular). The verb is ramati(delights, 3rd person, singular,
active, indicative, present tense). This verb has two attributes, the adverb
sadā(always) and the noun dhamme (in the Dharma, locative singular). This word
has the compound ariyappavedite (in the [Dharma] taught by the noble ones,
locative singular) as an attribute.

Commentary:
    King Mahākappina ruled in Kukkutavati. Once he heard from some merchants
about the Buddha and his teachings. He and several of his ministers immediately
left for Sāvatthi, where the Buddha was staying at that time.
    They met the Buddha sitting under a tree on the bank of a river. After
listening to his teachings, they immediately realized the Dharma and became
monks.
    When he did not return, his queen and wives of the ministers followed them
to Sāvatthi. When they arrived there, the Buddha hid the former king and his
ministers, because he knew that if the women saw their husbands in yellow robes
and with their heads shaved, it would be impossible for them to realize the
Dharma. So he just told them to sit down and listen to what he had to say,
their husbands would join them soon. He then delivered a discourse. At the end
the king and his ministers (they were sitting nearby) attained arahantship and
the queen and the wives of the ministers attained the first stage of
awakenment. The ladies also joined the Order and soon became arahants too.
    Venerable Mahākappina would often exclaim: "Oh, what happiness!" When the
other monks asked the Buddha what he meant, he replied with this verse,
explaining that Mahākappina tasted the nectar of the Dharma and found it
extremely sweet. He therefore lives happily, with a bright mind.
