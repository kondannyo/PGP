Commentary:
    Nigamavātissa was born and grew up in a small market town near Sāvatthi. He
became a monk and lived a simple life. For his alms food he went to the village
where his relatives lived and he kept away from all the big occasions. Even
when big benefactors like Anāthapiṇḍika and king Pasenadi of Kosala gave monks
alms on a grand scale, he did not attend. Some monks started to say, that he
keeps only to his relatives and does not care about things.
    The Buddha asked him about this. He replied that he goes to his village
only for alms food, takes only as much as is enough, does not care if it is
tasty or not. The Buddha praised him and told the other monks that they should
all behave in this way. He also related the story of the king of parrots:
    He lived in a grove of fig trees on the banks of Ganga with many subjects.
When all the fruits were eaten, everybody left, except for the king, who was
satisfied with little. Once Sakka, the king of gods, wanted to test him and his
resolve. He assumed the form of a goose and asked him why doesn't he move away.
The king said he can not leave out of the gratitude towards the tree. If he can
find enough food to get by, he wouldn't go. It would be ungrateful. Sakka was
impressed and revealed himself. Then he poured the Ganga water over the
withered tree and it was suddenly green and full of fruit.
    Then the Buddha said, that the king of parrots was himself in one of his
previous existences and Sakka was Anuruddha, one of the Buddha's foremost
disciples. He then uttered this verse (DhP 32). At the end of the discourse,
Nigamavātissa became an arahant.
