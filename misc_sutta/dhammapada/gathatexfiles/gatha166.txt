    This verse consists of two syntactically separate sentences. They are:
    1) attadatthaj paratthena bahuna pi na hapaye (let one not neglect one's
own spiritual attainment for other's spiritual attainment, however great). The
subject is omitted; the verb implies the third person singular pronoun. The
verb is hapaye (let neglect, 3rd person, singular, active, causative,
optative). It is negated by the negative particle na (not). The verb has an
attribute, the compound paratthena (for other's spiritual attainment, lit. by
other's spiritual attainment, instrumental singular). This word has an
attribute, the adjective bahuna (for great, lit. by great, instrumental
singular). It is further modified by the particle pi (even). The object is the
compound attadatthaj (one's own spiritual attainment, accusative singular).
    2) attadattham abhibbaya sadatthapasuto siya (having fully understood one's
own spiritual attainment, let one pursue a true attainment). This can be
further analysed into two segments:
    a) attadattham abhibbaya (having fully understood one's own spiritual
attainment). The subject is omitted; the verb implies the third person singular
pronoun. The verb is in gerund, abhibbaya (having fully understood). The object
is the compound attadatthaj (one's own spiritual attainment, accusative
singular).
    b) sadatthapasuto siya (let one pursue the true attainment). The subject is
omitted; the verb implies the third person singular pronoun. The verb is siya
(let one be, 3rd person, singular, active, optative). The object is the
compound sadatthapasuto (pursuing the true attainment, nominative singular).

Commentary:
    Close to the age of eighty, the Buddha declared that he would attain his
final Parinirvana in four months. There were many monks who have not reached
the final goal yet and they were very distressed. They wept and kept close to
the Buddha all the time. There was a monk, named Attadatta who decided to honor
the Buddha by attaining the Awakenment during his lifetime. So he kept alone
and practiced diligently. Some other monks did not understand his intention and
told Buddha, "Attadatta does not love you, he did not come to pay homage to
you! He is egoistic, indeed!" Attadatta explained his behavior, saying that in
his opinion the greatest homage to Buddha would be if he attained the
Arahantship within the remaining four months of the Buddha's life.
    The Buddha approved of this and replied with this verse, saying that in
spiritual attainment, one should diligently strive to reach the goal oneself
and only then do other things.
