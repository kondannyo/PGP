abhittharetha, V.: make haste, be quick. It is probably a misspelling of
abhittaretha (with the same meaning). It is derived from the verb root tar- (to
make haste, to move quickly, to hurry) with the prefix abhi- (intensifying
sense). 2.Pl.act.opt. = abhittharetha.
kalyane: kalyana-, Adj.: good, virtuous. As an N.n.: goodness, meritorious
action. Loc.Sg. = kalyane.
papa:papa-, N.n.: evil, wrong doing. Abl.Sg. = papa.
cittaj: citta-, N.n.: mind. Acc.Sg. = cittaj.
nivaraye, V.: to keep back, to restrain. The verb root is var- (to obstruct)
with the prefix ni- (out, from). 3.Sg.act.caus.opt. = nivaraye.
dandhaj: dandha-, Adj.: slow. Acc.Sg.n. = dandhaj.
List of Abbreviations
hi, part.: indeed.
karoto: karont-, Adj.: doing. It is an a.pr.p. of the verb root kar- (to do).
Gen.Sg.m. = karoto.
pubbaj: pubba-, N.n.: good deed, meritorious deed, merit. Acc.Sg. = pubbaj.
papasmij: papa-, N.n.: see above. Loc.Sg. = papasmij.
ramati, V.: delights. The verb root is ram- (to enjoy, to delight in).
3.Sg.act.in.pres. = ramati. The form ramati is sometimes used in poetry.
mano: mano-, N.n.: mind. Nom.Sg. = mano.
List of Abbreviations
    This sentence consists of three syntactically separate sentences. They are:

    1) abhittharetha kalyane (you should be quick in doing good). The subject
of this sentence is omitted. The verb indicates the second person plural
pronoun. The verb is abhittharetha (you should be quick, 2nd person, plural,
active, optative). The object is the adjective/noun kalyane (in good [things],
locative singular).
    2) papa cittaj nivaraye (one should restrain mind from evil). Again, the
subject is omitted, the verb form implying the third person singular pronoun.
The verb is nivaraye (one should restrain, 3rd person, singular, active,
optative). The object is the noun cittaj (mind, accusative singular) with its
attributed, the noun papa (from evil, ablative singular).
    3) dandhaj hi karoto pubbaj papasmij ramati mano (the mind of somebody, who
is slow in doing good, delights in evil). The subject of this sentence is the
noun mano (mind, nominative singular). Its main attribute is the active present
participle karoto (of the one, who is doing, genitive singular). This word has
an attribute, the noun pubbaj (good [things], accusative singular) and it in
turn has the adjective dandhaj (slow, accusative singular) as an attribute. It
is further stressed by the particle hi (indeed) which here serves mainly
metrical purposes. The verb is ramati (delights, 3rd person, singular, active,
indicative, present tense). The object is the noun papasmij (in evil, locative
singular).

Commentary:
    In Savatthi there lived a poor brahmin with his wife. They had only one
piece of outer garment, so only one of them could go out at one time. They were
lay disciple of the Buddha and wanted to hear as many of his discourses as
possible. So the brahmin would go to the monastery at night and his wife during
the day. Once the brahmin was listening to the Buddha and he felt very strong
wish to perform meritorious deeds. He wanted to offer his only piece of cloth
to the Buddha. But he realized that he and his wife would have nothing to wear
then. So his mind wavered and he hesitated. Finally during the last hours of
the night he offered his cloth to the Buddha, saying, "I win!"
    The king of Kosala, Pasenadi, was also present, and when he heard the
brahmin he sent messengers to ask why he shouted, "I win!" When he learned the
brahmin's story, he was very much impressed and decided to give him a reward.
He ordered the brahmin be offered a new piece of cloth. The brahmin gave that
piece also to the Buddha. The king gave him two pieces of cloth, which were
again offered to the Buddha. Pasenadi again doubled the number of clothes; the
brahmin again gave them to the Buddha. So at the end the king gave him thirty-
two pieces of cloth, the brahmin kept one for himself, one for his wife, and
remaining thirty he again offered to the Buddha.
    The king was so much impressed that he decided to reward the brahmin
further. He gave him two pieces of very expensive velvet cloth. The brahmin
made two canopies out of them, kept one for himself and his wife and the second
one he offered to the Buddha. The king then saw the canopy in the monastery and
realized that the brahmin has done a meritorious deed again. So he decided to
reward him even more.
    Some monks wondered how it was possible that in this case a good deed
brings good results so quickly. The Buddha replied, that had the brahmin
offered his garment immediately when the idea occurred to him, his reward would
have been much greater. He then added this verse, saying that if one wants to
perform meritorious deeds, one should do so quickly, without hesitation. If one
thinks about it too long, then maybe it becomes impossible to do anything at
all, because the mind delights in evil.
