Commentary:
    The story says that there was an heir of a rich family, named
Kumbhaghosaka, once in the city of Rājagaha. His parents died in the epidemic
and he alone escaped and lived in the forest for some time. When he returned,
nobody recognized him. He did not want to use the family wealth (which was
buried in a safe place) out of fear that people might think he found it
accidentally and thus the king might confiscate it. So he found a job (waking
people in the morning) and lived a poor life.
    But the king saw him once and recognized that his voice and manners are of
a man of great wealth. He then sent his maid to investigate. At the end he
summoned Kumbhaghosaka to the court. There the young man told him the story and
the king made him a banker and gave his daughter in marriage to him.
    When the Buddha heard about it, he spoke this verse.
    If one always acts properly, with energy and mindfulness, applies self-
control and consideration, is always conscientious, his good repute will
increase, because people will know that he is a man of honor, that they can
trust him. And they will report this to the others - who will then come to see
for themselves, again telling other people about this. So the good word will
spread around and everybody will trust such a person.
