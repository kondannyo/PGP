Commentary:
    Some ascetics were planning to kill Venerable Moggallana because they
thought that the Buddha and his teaching would be hurt by this action. So they
hired a group of killers who surrounded the cave where Moggallana was staying.
But he used his supernatural powers and escaped. The killers did not give up
but were pursuing him around the clock. After three months Moggallana realized
that he had to get caught as a consequence of one bad deed he committed in one
of his previous life. Although he was an Arahant and did not create any new
karma, he was still reaping fruit of his actions before he reached the
Awakenment.
    So he let himself to be caught and the killers beat him up. When they
thought he was dead, they left him in a forest and went away. But Moggallana
was still alive, used his supernatural powers to revive himself for a short
time and went to pay his respects to the Buddha. He told the Buddha what
happened and the Buddha asked him to teach the Dharma to all the monks for one
last time. Moggallana did so and died soon after that.
    The king ordered an investigation, caught the killers and executed them.
The monks asked the Buddha how was it possible that Moggallana was killed like
that. The Buddha told them a story from Moggallana previous life.
    Once he was a son of blind parents. At the beginning he was a very good
son, treating them well. But after he got married, his wife hated his parents
and induced him to kill them. Moggallana took his parents to the forest and
beat them to death, while pretending that some robbers were actually killing
them. For this deed he had to die himself in his very last existence at the end
of killers, beaten up to death.
