sududdasaṃ: sududdasa-, Adj.: very difficult to see. The word duddasa-, Adj.
difficult to see with the prefix su-. This prefix usually means "well", "good"
etc., but here it further strengthens the adjective. The word duddasa- itself

difficult). Acc.Sg.n. = sududdasaṃ.

List of Abbreviations
yatthakāmanipātinaṃ: yatthakāmanipātin-, Adj: jumping at whatever it desires.
It is a complex compound of:
    yatthakāmaṃ, Adv.: according to one's desire. The disappearance of the
final -ṃ is
    only an omission, perhaps due to the metrical requirements. It can be
further analyzed as:
        yattha, Rel.Adv.: where.
        kāma-, N.m.: desire, pleasure.
    nipātin-, Adj.: falling down, chancing upon. It is derived (by the way of
adding
    the possessive suffix -in) from the verb root pat- (fall) with the prefix
ni- (down).
Acc.Sg.n. = yatthakāmanipātinaṃ.
cittaṃ: citta-, N.n.: mind. Acc.Sg. = cittaṃ.
List of Abbreviations

List of Abbreviations
    This verse consists of two grammatically separated sentences. One is:
sududdasaṃ sunipuṇaṃ yatthakāmanipātinaṃ cittaṃ rakkhetha medhāvī (o Wise Ones,
you should protect the mind, which is very difficult to see, very subtle and
jumping at whatever it desires). Here the subject is the word medhāvī (o Wise
Ones, vocative plural). The verb is rakkhetha (you should protect, 2nd person
plural, active, optative). The object is cittaṃ (mind, accusative singular)
with three attributes: 1) sududdasaṃ (very difficult to see), 2) sunipuṇaṃ
(very subtle), 3) yatthakāmanipātinaṃ (jumping at whatever it desires). They
all have to agree with the object and are therefore in accusative singular.
    The second sentence is cittaṃ guttaṃ sukhāvahaṃ (restrained mind brings
happiness). Here the subject is the word cittaṃ (mind, nominative singular). It
has an attribute, the past participle guttaṃ (protected, nominative singular).
The verb is omitted, the verb "to be" again being implied. The word sukhāvahaṃ
(happiness-bringing, nominative singular) forms an attribute to this verb.

Commentary:
    Once in the city of Sāvatthi, there lived a son of a banker. He asked a
monk who came to his house for alms food, how to be liberated from the ills of
life. The monk instructed him to divide his property into three parts. One he
was to do business with, one to support his family, one for charity. The man
did so and then asked what to do next. He was instructed to take refuge in the
Buddha, Dharma and Sangha and to observe five precepts. But the man was still
not satisfied. So the monk told him to renounce the world and to become a monk
too.
    As a monk he was taught Dharma by one teacher and Vinaya by another. Thus
he felt that there was too much to learn, the rules were too strict and there
was no freedom. He wanted to return to lay life. He began to have doubts, was
discontent and unhappy, neglected his meditation. The Buddha told him that if
he only could control his mind, he had nothing else to control. Then he told
him this verse. The monk attained arahantship.
