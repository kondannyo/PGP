Commentary:
    During the times of the past Buddha Kassapa, there was a monk. Once he
committed a wrong deed and was tormented by regret. He was not able to overcome
this and concentrate on his practice. Therefore he made no progress and was
reborn as a Naga. Nagas are mythological beings, snakes that can change into
humans. They are believed to have miraculous powers.
    This Naga's name was Erakapatta. He had a beautiful daughter. He announced
that whoever could answer her questions, could marry her. Many young men tried
but nobody was successful.
    Once a young man named Uttara was on his way to try to answer the
questions. The Buddha saw that he was very close to attaining the first stage
of Awakenment, therefore he taught him answers to the questions. Immediately,
Uttara attained the first stage. As a result, he had no longer desire for the
Naga princess. But he still went there to answer her questions.
    The girl asked: "Who is a ruler?
    Uttara replied: "Who controls his six senses."
    "Is someone overpowered by moral defilements to be called a ruler?"
    "No, only who is free from moral defilements can be called a ruler."
    "What ruler is free from moral defilements?"
    "One who is free from selfishness."
    "Who is to be called a fool?"
    "One who strives after sensual pleasures is a fool."
    Uttara then answered many more questions. When Erakapatta found out that
somebody was able to answer, he realized that a Buddha was again in this world.
He asked Uttara to take him to the Buddha. There he paid homage to the Buddha
and related his story.
    The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that it is extremely rare to be
born as a human being, and even rarer to be able to hear the Dharma from the
mouth of a Buddha.
    At the end of the discourse many monks attained Arahantship or at least the
first stage of Awakenment.
