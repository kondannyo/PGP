Commentary:
    When the Buddha attained Awakenment, one of his first big journeys took him
to the city of Kapilavatthu, where most of his family lived. He stayed at the
outskirts of the city, in the Nigrodharama monastery. His father, king
Suddhodana, assumed, that his son would come to his palace for food and made a
lot of almsfood prepared. However, he did not invite the Buddha, as was
necessary.
    So the Buddha went on almsround around the city, as was his custom. He
asked himself, if this was the proper course of action and realized that all
the Buddhas of the past also went on almsround around the city they were born.
    Suddhodana heard about it and went to the Buddha, saying, "Why should my
son ask for alms in the very city, where he used to travel in a golden
palanquin? I am so ashamed!"
    The Buddha explained to him that he was only following the old custom of
all the Buddhas and did not wish to put Suddhodana to shame. He also uttered
this verse and the following one (DhP 169). The king finally accepted it and
was no longer offended.
