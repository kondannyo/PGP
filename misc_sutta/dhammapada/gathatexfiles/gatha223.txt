Commentary:
    In Savathi there lived a rich man named Sumana. He had a servant named
Punna. Once Punna and his wife offered almsfood to Venerable Sariputta and as a
result of this deed, Punna found gold in the field he was ploughing. The king
declared him to be the royal banker and the whole family became extremely rich
and influential. Once Punna and his family were offering almsfood to the Buddha
and the monks for seven days. After hearing the Dharma from the Buddha the
whole family, Punna, his wife and their daughter Uttara, attained the
Awakenment.
    Uttara got married to the son of Sumana. Because the family was not
Buddhist, she was not able to perform meritorious deeds. Her father sent her
some money and arranged for a woman named Sirima to look after the household
for a few days.
    During this time, Uttara was offering almsfood to the Buddha and the monks.
When her husband saw her, he smiled, because he did not understand the
significance of giving and thought her stupid. But Sirima, seeing him smile,
forgot she was there only for a few days, and became jealous. She brought some
boiling oil with the intention to pour it over the head of Uttara. Uttara knew
what was about to happen but she did not feel any anger or hatred. She was very
grateful to Sirima, because only with her help was she able to perform
meritorious deeds. She made a firm resolution not to let any anger or hatred
enter her mind.
    The boiling oil then became harmless, like cold water. Sirima did not
understand and went to get another pot of hot oil. But by then other servants
caught her and beat her up.
    Then Sirima realized what she had done and asked Uttara for forgiveness.
Uttara told her to go to see "her father" - she meant the Buddha, who has
taught her the Dharma and helped her to reach the Awakenment.
    The Buddha listened to all what happened. Then he praised Uttara for not
feeling any anger or hatred. He told her this verse. At the end, Uttara forgave
Sirima.
