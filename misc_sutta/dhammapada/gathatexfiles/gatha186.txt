    This verse consists of two syntactically separate sentences. They are:
    1) na kahapanavassena titti kamesu vijjati (even by rain of coins one
cannot be satisfied in sensual desires, lit.: even by rain of coins there
doesn't exist a satisfaction in sensual desires). The subject of this sentence
is the noun titti (satisfaction, nominative singular). It has an attribute, the
noun kamesu (in sensual desires, locative plural). The verb is vijjati (is
found, 3rd person, singular, passive, indicative, present tense). It is negated
by the negative particle na (not). The verb has an attribute, the compound
kahapanavassena (by rain of coins, instrumental singular).
    2) appassada dukkha kama iti vibbaya pandito (the wise man, having
understood, that sensual desires give little pleasure and are painful). This
can be further analysed into the main sentence a) and the direct speech b):
    a) vibbaya pandito (the wise man, having understood that). The subject is
the noun pandito (wise man, nominative singular). The verb is in gerund,
vibbaya (having understood).
    b) appassada dukkha kama iti (sensual desires give little pleasure and are
painful). The subject is the noun kama (sensual desires, nominative plural). It
has two attributes, the compound appassada (giving little pleasure, nominative
plural) and the adjective dukkha (painful, nominative plural). The verb is
omitted, implying the verb "to be". The particle iti (symbolizes the end of the
direct speech) connects the clause to the main sentence.

Commentary:
    At the Jetavana monastery there was a young monk. His teacher sent him to
another monastery to practice meditation. While he was away, his father died
and left some money for him with his brother. When the monk returned, he found
out about this, but decided to continue living as a monk and told his brother
to keep the money for himself.
    Later, however, he began to regret, started to imagine his comfortable life
as a layman with that amount of money. He became dissatisfied with his life as
a monk and began loosing weight. Other monks persuaded him to seek help from
the Buddha.
    The Buddha told the monk this verse (and the following one, see DhP 187),
saying that there is simply never enough money to satisfy the hunger. He told
him the story of a king named Mandhatu, who had been a Universal Monarch a long
time ago. He was reborn in Tavatimsa heaven and enjoyed immense riches and
power for a long time. Then he started to wish he were the only ruler of
Tavatimsa instead of Sakka, the king of the gods. Immediately he died and fell
down from his heavenly state.
    The young monk decided to continue his life as a monk and strived
diligently to attain the Awakenment.
