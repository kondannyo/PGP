    This verse consists of two related sentences. They both form the first and
the second lines of this verse respectively.
    In the first sentence, the subject is the relative pronoun yo (who,
nominative singular). It has two attributes, the adjectives dussilo (with bad
morality, nominative singular) and asamahito (not firm, nominative singular).
The verb is jive (should live, 3rd person, singular, active, optative). It has
an attribute, the compound vassasataj (hundred years, accusative singular). The
conjunction ca (and) serves only for metrical purposes.
    In the second line, the subject is the adjective/noun jivitaj (life,
nominative singular). It has three attributes. First of them is the compound
ekahaj (one day, nominative singular). Second and third are the adjectives
silavantassa (of a virtuous one, genitive singular) and jhayino (of a
meditating one, genitive singular). The object is the adjective seyyo
(nominative singular). The verb is omitted, implying the verb "to be".

Commentary:
    A group of monks took a subject of meditation from the Buddha and went to a
forest village to practice. There were robbers in the jungle around the
village. They wanted to make a human sacrifice and they decided to offer one of
the monks to the spirits of the forest. They went to the monastery and told the
monks to select one of them who would follow them to the jungle and be
sacrificed. All of the monks volunteered. There was a young novice with them,
named Samkicca. Although he was very young, he was already an Arahant. He told
the monks that Venerable Sariputta sent him to that place with the task to be
the one to go with the robbers. Although the other monks did not like it a lot,
still they trusted in Sariputta's judgment and so let Samkicca go.
    The bloody sacrifice was prepared deep in the jungle and the leader of the
robbers took a sword and wanted to cut the young novice's head. At that time,
Samkicca was in deep meditation and the sword did not cut him, but just curled
up. The robber took another sword and hit again - only to find that the sword
has bent upward. Samkicca was still unharmed. The robbers were terrified; all
of them knelt down at the novice's feet and asked for forgiveness. They also
asked his permission to become monks. He complied with this request and
returned to the monastery with the new monks.
    Everybody was very happy that Samkicca was unharmed and that he managed to
bring the robbers into the Sangha. They all left for Savatthi to pay homage to
the Buddha and Venerable Sariputta. The Buddha then admonished them with this
verse, saying that it is better to live just for one day, but virtuously and in
meditation, than to live a very long life, but immorally and without any self-
control.
