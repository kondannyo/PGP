List of Abbreviations
    This verse consists of two syntactically separate sentences. They are:
    1) attanam eva pathamaj patirupe nivesaye athabbam anusaseyya (let one
first establish oneself in what is proper and then instruct others). This can
be further analysed into two segments:
    a) attanam eva pathamaj patirupe nivesaye (let one first establish oneself
in what is proper). The subject is omitted; the verb implies the third person
singular pronoun. The verb is nivesaye (should establish oneself, 3rd person,
singular, active, causative). It has an attribute, the adjective patirupe (in
[what is] proper, locative singular). The object is the noun attanaj (oneself,
accusative singular) with its attribute, the adverb pathamaj (first) which is
further stressed by the particle eva (just).
    b) athabbam anusaseyya (and then instruct others). Again, the subject is
omitted and the verb implies the third person singular pronoun. The verb is
anusaseyya (should instruct, 3rd person, singular, active, optative). The
object is the adjective abbam (other [person], accusative singular). The adverb
atha (then) introduces this segment and connects it to the previous one.
    2) na kilisseyya pandito (a wise one should not be impure). The subject is
the noun pandito (a wise one, nominative singular). The verb kilisseyya (should
be impure, 3rd person, singular, active, optative) is negated by the negative
particle na (not).

Commentary:
    There was a monk named Upananda. He was a very good orator. He would preach
eloquently about being satisfied with little, about contentment and about
austerity, but actually he was very greedy and always took all he could get.
    Once he wanted to spend the Rain Retreat in one monastery. When he found
out that at the end of the retreat the monks there received only one robe each,
he decided to go away. But he left his slippers there. It was similar at the
second monastery, where the monks usually got two robes - he did not stay but
left his staff. At the third monastery he left his water bottle, but himself
left, because three robes that monks received there, did not satisfy him.
Finally, he spent the Rain Retreat in the fourth monastery, where he received
four robes at the end of the retreat. Because he left his things in three
previous temples, he also claimed his share of the robes from them!
    So, he set on the way back to his own monastery with ten robes. On the way
he met two monks, who could not agree how to divide two robes and a blanket
between themselves. Upananda agreed to act as an arbiter. He gave each of them
one robe and he himself kept the blanket as a payment for his arbitration.
    The monks went to see the Buddha and reported to him what happened. The
Buddha reprimanded Upananda with this verse, saying that before one can teach
others, he has to act properly - especially in the subject he wants to teach.
