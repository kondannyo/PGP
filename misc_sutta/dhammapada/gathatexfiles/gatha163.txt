    This verse consists of two syntactically separate sentences. They are:
    1) sukarani asadhuni attano ahitani ca (easy done are deeds, that are wrong
and harmful to oneself). This sentence has two subjects, the adjective/noun
asadhuni (bad deeds, nominative plural) and the adjective ahitani (harmful,
nominative plural). This last word has an attribute, the noun attano (to
oneself, genitive singular). The two subjects are connected by the conjunction
ca (and). The verb is omitted, implying the verb "to be". The object is the
adjective sukarani (easy to do, nominative plural).
    2) yaj ve hitaj ca sadhuj ca taj ve paramadukkaraj (what is beneficial and
good, that is indeed most difficult to do). This can be further analyzed into
two segments:
    a) yaj ve hitaj ca sadhuj ca (what is beneficial and good). The subject is
the relative pronoun yaj (what, nominative singular). The verb is omitted,
implying the verb "to be". There are two objects, the adjectives hitaj
(beneficial, nominative singular) and sadhuj (good, nominative singular). They
are connected by two conjunctions ca (and). The particle ve (indeed) serves
mainly for metrical purposes.
    b) taj ve paramadukkaraj (that is indeed most difficult to do). The subject
is the pronoun taj (that, nominative singular). The verb is omitted, implying
the verb "to be". The object is the adjective compound paramadukkaraj (most
difficult to do, nominative singular). The particle ve (indeed) serves mainly
for metrical purposes.

Commentary:
    The Buddha had a cousin Devadatta. He also became a monk but he was vicked.
He envied the Buddha and wanted to take his place as the head of the Buddhist
community. He went to see the Buddha and suggested, that since the Buddha is
getting old, he, Devadatta should from now on be the leader of the Buddhist
Order. The Buddha refused. Devadatta then tried to kill the Buddha three times,
but he was not successful.
    Later Devadatta had another plan. He went to see the Buddha and suggested
five new rules for all monks to follow: 1) to live only in forests, 2) to eat
only almsfood, 3) to wear only robes they make themselves from discarded pieces
of cloth found on rubbish heaps, 4) to sleep under trees, 5) not to eat any
meat (including fish).
    The Buddha told him that, whoever wants to follow these rules, can do so.
But they will not become binding for all the monks, because they are too strict
and the Buddha's teaching teaches the Middle Path.
    Devadatta was angry and tried to find some more followers. Indeed, he found
some young monks who thought the rules of Devadatta were much better than
those, introduced by the Buddha.
    The Buddha questioned Devadatta about his intentions and the later admitted
ha was trying to create a schism in the Community. The Buddha tried to explain
him that to create a schism is a very bad deed, but Devadatta did not care. He
took his followers and departed for the place called Gayasisa where he
established a new Order. Two prominents disciple of the Buddha, Sariputta and
Moggallana were able to make most of the Devadatta's followers realize their
mistake and make them come back to the Buddha.
    The Buddha commented the situation with this verse, saying that good and
beneficial deeds are very difficult to perform, whereas an evil deed is done
very quickly and without any difficulty.
