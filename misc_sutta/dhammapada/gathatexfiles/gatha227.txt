Commentary:
    There was a man named Atula. Once he and his friends wanted to hear the
Dharma. They went to see Venerable Revata. But he was practicing meditation and
did not tell them anything. They were disappointed and so went to see Venerable
Sariputta. He expounded the Dharma in length, telling them many profound
teachings they did not quite understand. Still unhappy, they went to Venerable
Ananda. He explained shortly basic teachings of the Buddha.
    Atula and his friends then went to see the Buddha. They complained. Revata
did not say anything at all, Sariputta spoke too much and Ananda too little.
After such a long time, they still were not satisfied. The Buddha replied with
this verse (and the following ones, DhP 228, DhP 229 and DhP 230), saying that,
as before, so today, there is no one who is never blamed.
