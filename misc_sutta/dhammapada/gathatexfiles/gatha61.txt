    There are two sentences in this verse:
    1) caraṃ ce nādhigaccheyya seyyaṃ sadisam attano ekacariyaṃ daḷhaṃ kayirā
(if a wanderer should not find a companion better or similar to oneself, then
he should resolutely wander alone). This sentence can be further divided into
two sentences.
    a) First is caraṃ ce nādhigaccheyya seyyaṃ sadisam attano (if a wanderer
should not find a companion better or similar to oneself). The subject of this
sentence is the active present participle caraṃ(wanderer, nominative singular).
The verb is adhigaccheyya (should find, 3rd person, singular, active, optative)
negated by the negative particle na (not). There are two objects, seyyaṃ
(better, accusative singular) and sadisam (similar, accusative singular) which
share the same attribute, the noun/reflexive pronoun attano (one self's,
genitive singular). The particle ce (if) connects the sentence to the following
one.
    b) The second sentence is ekacariyaṃ daḷhaṃ kayirā (he should resolutely
wander alone). Here, the subject is omitted; the active present participle
caraṃ from the first sentence is implied. The verb is kayirā (should do, 3rd
person, singular, active, optative) with the adjectivedaḷhaṃ (strong,
accusative singular) as an attribute. The object of this sentence is the noun
ekacariyaṃ(wandering alone, accusative singular).
    2) natthi bāle sahāyatā (there is no companionship with a fool). The
subject of this sentence is the noun sahāyatā (companionship, nominative
singular). The noun is atthi (is, 3rd person, singular, active, indicative,
present tense) negated by the negative particle na (not). The object is the
word bāle (with the fool, in the fool, locative singular).

Commentary:
    Venerable Mahākassapa was once staying near Rājagaha. At that time he had
two novices with him. One of them was very good, diligent, respectful and
obedient whereas the other one was lazy, disrespectful and naughty.
    When Kassapa admonished the bad novice, he became angry. One day he went to
the village to get some food and lied that Kassapa was sick. So the people gave
him very good food for Venerable Kassapa. But the novice ate all himself and
came back to Kassapa empty-handed. He was admonished once again, but instead of
repenting he became even angrier.
    The next day when Kassapa left for his alms-round, the young novice broke
all things and set fire to the monastery.
    When the Buddha heard about this he spoke this verse, remarking that it
would be better for Kassapa to live alone than to associate himself with such a
fool.
