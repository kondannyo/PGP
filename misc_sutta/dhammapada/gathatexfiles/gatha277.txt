Commentary:
    Once a group of monks obtained a subject of meditation from the Buddha.
They went to the forest and practiced meditation. However, they made a little
progress. Therefore they returned to the Buddha and asked him for another
subject of meditation. The Buddha reflected that due to their past lives they
were ready to perceive the impermanence of things. He told them this verse and
advised them to meditate on its meaning.
