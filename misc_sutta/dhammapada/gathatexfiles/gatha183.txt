List of Abbreviations
The subject of this sentence is sasanaj (teaching). It is in the nominative
case. Its attribute buddhana (of the Buddhas) is in genitive plural.
Also in nominative is the object, etaj (this). The verb is omitted (and thus it
is the verb "to be").
The first three lines form three secondary objects, enumerating what the main
object (etaj, this) means.
The first of them is sabbapapassa akaranaj (non-doing of all evil). Actually,
the object here is only the word akaranaj (non-doing), which is therefore in
nominative. The word sabbapapassa (of all evil) is only its attribute, being in
genitive case. Note that this word is a compound, instead of sabbassa papassa
(of all evil, both words separated and in genitive case) we write just
sabbapapassa, having the same meaning.
Next one is kusalassa upasampada (gathering the wholesome). Again, the word
upasampada (gathering) is the object in the nominative. Its attribute kusalassa
(of the wholesome [things]) is in genitive.
Last is sacittapariyodapanaj. It is in nominative and it is a compound that can
be described as sacittassa (of one's own mind) pariyodapanaj(purification), or
even sassa (of own) citassa (of mind) pariyodapanaj (purification).

Commentary:
This gatha, simply said, is Buddhism in a nutshell. Truly, what can be
explained and expanded in hundreds of books, can be also abbreviated into three
main guidelines. Not doing evil deeds - the first step on the road to
Awakenment. But what exactly are "evil deeds"? A deed is considered evil if it
brings suffering to any living being.
After one refrains from doing evil deeds one needs to do good deeds - to
"gather" them like flowers. Good deeds are deeds that help living beings. They
are based on loving kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy and equanimity. In
order to be able to do so, one must cultivate these feelings in one's heart and
mind.
These two steps are only preparatory stages to the final and most important
action - purification of mind. The first two stages are here to prepare our
mind for the highest goal. Without them it would be indeed impossible to purify
our minds, for a mind that harbors evil thoughts can not purify itself.
The last verse mentions that this is the teaching of the buddhas. Why is the
plural form used here? The historical Buddha Shakyamuni is believed to be just
one from the long succession of Awakened beings, buddhas, who reach the nirvana
by themselves and the become teachers of the Dharma. And as this verse states,
their teachings might differ, but these three basic patterns do not change in
either of them. Therefore, these lines can truly be described as the very core
of Buddha's teaching.
