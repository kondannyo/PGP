    This verse contains two connected sentences. They form the first and the
second line of the verse respectively.
    In the first sentence, the subject is the noun vaca (speeches, nominative
plural). It has two attributes, the numeral sahassam (thousand, nominative
singular - note that the numeral sahassa- is always in neuter) and the compound
anatthapadasajhita (without meaningful words, nominative plural). There are two
particles, api (also, even) and ce (if) which form a phrase api ce (even if).
    In the second sentence, the subject is the compound atthapadaj (meaningful
word, nominative singular). It has the numeral ekaj (one, nominative singular)
as an attribute. There is a clause, which forms an attribute to the subject:
yaj sutva upasammati (after hearing which, one can attain calm). The subject
here is the relative pronoun yaj (which, accusative singular). There are two
verbs, one is the gerundive sutva (having heard) and one is upasammati (calms
down, 3rd person, singular, active, indicative, present tense). These two form
the verbal phrase sutva - upasammati (having heard, calms). The object of the
sentence is the adjective seyyo (better, nominative singular).

Commentary:
Once there was a former public executioner named Tambadathika. Once he went for
a bath to the river and took some food with him. Just as he was leaving the
house, Venerable Sariputta stopped by his door on his way for almsfood.
Tambadathika offered him his food.
    After the meal, Sariputta taught him the Dharma. But Tambadathika's mind
was not peaceful, because he was disturbed and feeling remorse recollecting his
past work. This did not allow him to pay attention to the Dharma. Sariputta
asked him if he killed those people because he wanted to, out of hate or anger
– or was it just an order. Tambadathika replied that he was ordered to kill
them by the king and personally did not feel hate towards them. So Sariputta
reassured him that he did nothing wrong. Tambadathika then calmed down and
listened to the Dharma attentively. He then accompanied Sariputta on the way
back to the monastery. But on the way back home he died due to an accident.
    The Buddha was told about this and he remarked that Tambadathika was reborn
in Tusita heaven. The monks wondered how it was possible for somebody who
killed so many people in his life to be reborn there. The Buddha told them by
this verse that just one meaningful sentence that helped his mind to calm down
and concentrate on the Dharma helped him to achieve this goal. For if one dies
with a peaceful mind, one's rebirth is good. If at the time of death our mind
is confused or angry - we face a bad rebirth.
