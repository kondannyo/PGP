Commentary:
    Venerable Ananda once met a young beggar who was going around dressed in
old rags and holding a begging plate. After meeting Ananda, the man decided to
become a monk. His name was Pilotika.
    When he became a monk, he put his old clothes and the plate under a certain
tree. Sometimes he felt not satisfied with his life as a monk and he went back
to the tree and contemplated going back to the layman's life. But when he
realized how miserable were his days before he became a monk, he felt shame and
returned to the monastery.
    This happened many times. Other monks asked him where was he going all the
time. He told them he went to see his teacher. Pilotika considered his old
clothes and the plate to be his teacher, because they taught him futility of
the lay life many times. He started to practice earnestly and took his old
clothes as a meditation subject. Soon he was able to reach Awakenment and
therefore he stopped going to the tree.
    Other monks asked him again, why does not he go to see his teacher any
more. Pilotika replied that he does not have need for a teacher any more,
hinting that he was an Arahant. The monks went to see the Buddha and asked him
if it was true, if Pilotika has really reached the goal. The Buddha replied in
affirmative, saying that indeed Pilotika now has no need to see his "teacher"
because he has nothing to learn from the old clothes anymore. He has realized
the truth and became an Arahant. The Buddha further added this verse and the
following one (DhP 144).
