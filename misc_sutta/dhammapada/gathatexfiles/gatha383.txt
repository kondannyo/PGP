stream [of suffering]). The subject is omitted; the verb implies the second
person singular pronoun. The verb is chinda (cut off, 2nd person, singular,
active, imperative). It has an attribute, the gerund parakkamma (having
undertaken). The object is the noun sotaj (stream, accusative singular).
    2) kame panuda brahmana (dispel sense-pleasures, Brahmin). The subject is
the noun brahmana (Brahmin, vocative singular). The verb is panuda (dispel, 2nd

pleasures, accusative plural).
    3) savkharanaj khayaj batva akatabbusi brahmana (having realized the

Commentary:
    A certain Brahmin in Savatthi was a follower of the Buddha. Often he
invited the monks to his house and he would address them as Arahants. Those
monks, who had not yet attained the Arahantship, were embarrassed and many
monks started to avoid the Brahmin's house.
    The Brahmin felt sad and asked the Buddha why so many monks stopped coming
to his house. The Buddha then questioned the monks and they told him about the
Brahmin's form of address. The Buddha told them that the Brahmin did not mean
anything bad; he spoke only out of his respect and devotion to the Arahants.
Then the Buddha spoke this verse, saying that monks should uproot the stream of
suffering, realize the destruction of conditioned things and experience the
Nirvana.
