List of Abbreviations
    This sentence consists of three syntactically separate sentences. They are:

    1) atta hi attano natho (one is indeed one's own lord). The subject is the
noun atta (one, self; nominative singular). The verb is omitted, implying the
verb "to be". The object is the noun natho (lord, nominative singular) with its
attribute, the noun/pronoun attano (one's own, genitive singular). The particle
hi (indeed) serves mainly for metrical purposes.
    2) ko hi natho paro siya (what other lord would there be?). The subject is
the interrogative particle ko (who, nominative singular). The verb is siya
(would be, 3rd person, singular, active, optative). The object is the noun
natho (lord, nominative singular) with its attribute, the adjective paro
(other). The particle hi (indeed) serves mainly for metrical purposes.
    3) attana'va sudantena nathaj labhati dullabhaj (with oneself well
restrained, one will obtain the lord that is so hard to get). The subject is
omitted; the verb implies the third person singular pronoun. The verb is
labhati (obtains, 3rd person, singular, active, indicative, present tense). It
has an attribute, the noun attana (by oneself, instrumental singular). This in
turn has the adjective sudantena (by well restrained, instrumental singular) as
an attribute. The object is the noun nathaj (lord, accusative singular) with
its attribute, the adjective dullabhaj (difficult to get, accusative singular).
The particle va (just) serves mainly for metrical purposes.

Commentary:
    There was a young married woman who wanted to become a nun. She got
permission from her husband and entered the Order. She became a pupil of
Devadatta, the Buddha's cousin. Before she became a nun, she was already
pregnant but did not know about it. When she found out, she asked Devadatta
what to do. He sent her back to the lay life. But the woman was not happy and
went to see the Buddha. The Buddha sent for Upali, who was the master of
Vinaya, rules of conduct. He further asked the king Pasenadi and the famous lay
devotes, Anathapindika and Visakha to come and settle the case.
    Visakha examined the young woman and told Upali that she was already
pregnant when she joined the Order. Upali therefore declared that the woman was
pure of any misconduct and could continue her life as a nun. Later the woman
gave birth to a son. He was named Kumara Kassapa and king Pasenadi adopted him.
At the age of seven, the boy became a novice and when he was eighteen, he
received the full ordination. He went to the forest to practice meditation and
soon attained Arahantship. He lived in the forest for twelve years and then
went back to the monastery.
    His mother was very attached to him and whenever she saw him she would run
after him calling his name. Kumara Kassapa decided that he should help his
mother to get rid of this attachment. Therefore he spoke coolly to her, "How is
it possible that you, as a nun, can not cut off even the affection for your
son?" The woman reflected, "I have been weeping for twelve years, waiting for
my son. Now he speaks so harshly to me! Why should I be attached to him?" Then
she realized danger of all attachments and very soon reached Arahanthsip.
    The monks then remarked to the Buddha that if the woman had listened to
Devadatta's words, neither she nor her son would have reached Arahantship. The
Buddha replied with this verse, saying that in striving for the goal one must
depend only on himself and not seek others to lean on.
