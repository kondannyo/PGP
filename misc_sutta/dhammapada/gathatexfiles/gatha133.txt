List of Abbreviations
    This verse consists of four syntactically separate sentences. They are:
    1) mavoca pharusaj kabci (do not say anything harsh). The subject of this
sentence is omitted. The verb implies the second person singular pronoun. The
verb is avoca ([you] said, 3rd person, singular, active, aorist). It is negated
by the negative particle ma (do not). These two words form a phrase "do not
say". The object is the adjective pharusaj (harsh, accusative singular) with
its attribute, the pronoun kabci (anything, accusative singular).

of this sentence is the past participle vutta (spoken, nominative plural). The
verb is pativadeyyu (might reply, 3rd person, plural, active, optative). The
object is the pronoun taj (to that, accusative singular).
    3) dukkha hi sarambhakatha(angry talk is painful). The subject is the
compound sarambhakatha (angry talk, nominative singular). The verb is omitted,
implying the verb "to be". The object is the adjective dukkha (painful,
nominative singular). The sentence is stressed by the particle hi (indeed)

Commentary:
    There was a monk named Kundadhana. From the day he became a monk, others
saw a female form always following him everywhere. But he himself did not see
anything.
    Once he went out on to gather alms food and people offered him two portions
of food, saying that one was for him and the other for his friend. Then they
reported to the king that one of the monks seems to have a girlfriend. The king
Pasenadi started to investigate the matter.
    When the king was in the room with the monk, the female form was not
present. The monk himself also professed his innocence. When the king sent him
out of the room, the female form suddenly appeared close to him. The king
realized that the woman was not real and the monk was really innocent. So he
invited him for almsfood.
    The other monks were not happy and started to scold Kundadhana, saying that
in fact he had a girlfriend somewhere and that he had no morals. Kundadhana got
angry and retorted with his own accusations.
    The Buddha then admonished him and told him this verse. He further
explained, that in his previous life Kundadhana was a deity who wanted to
create discord between two monks who very good friends. He would assume the
form of a woman and follow closely one of them, thus hoping to stop their
friendship. For that deed a female form was now following him.
