33 Sangīti Sutta: The Chanting Together
[207] 1.1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. Once the Lord was touring in the Malla country with a large company of about five hundred monks. Arrived at Pāvā, the Mallas’ capital, he stayed in the mango-grove of Cunda the smith.1012
1.2. Now at that time a new meeting-hall of the Mallas of Pāvā, called Ubbhaṭaka,1013 had recently been built, and it had not yet been occupied by any ascetic or Brahmin, or indeed by any human being. Hearing that the Lord was staying in Cunda’s mango-grove, the Mallas of Pāvā went to see him. Having saluted him, they sat down to one side and said: ‘Lord, the Mallas of Pāvā have recently erected a new meeting-hall called Ubbhataka, and it has not yet been occupied by any ascetic or Brahmin, or indeed by any human being. [208] May the Blessed Lord be the first to use it! Should he do so, that would be for the lasting good and happiness of the Mallas of Pāvā.′ And the Lord consented by silence.
1.3. Noting his assent, the Mallas rose, saluted him, passed out to his right and went to the meeting-hall. They spread mats all round, arranged seats, put out a water-pot and an oil-lamp, and then, returning to the Lord, saluted him, sat down to one side and reported what they had done, saying: ‘Whenever the Blessed Lord is ready.’
1.4. Then the Lord dressed, took his robe and bowl, and went to the meeting-hall with his monks. There he washed his feet, entered the hall and sat down against the central pillar, facing east. The monks, having washed their feet, entered the hall and sat down along the western wall facing east, [209] with the Lord in front of them. The Pāvā Mallas washed their feet, entered the hall, and sat down along the eastern wall facing west, with the Lord in front of them. Then the Lord spoke to the Mallas on Dhamma till far into the night, instructing, inspiring, firing and delighting them. Then he dismissed them, saying: ‘Vāsetthas,1014 the night has passed away.1015 Now do as you think fit.’ ‘Very good, Lord’, replied the Mallas. And they got up, saluted the Lord, and went out, passing him by on the right.
1.5. As soon as the Mallas had gone the Lord, surveying the monks sitting silently all about, said to the Venerable Sāriputta: ‘The monks are free from sloth-and-torpor,1016 Sāriputta. You think of a discourse on Dhamma to give to them. My back aches, I want to stretch it.’ ‘Very good, Lord’, replied Sāriputta. Then the Lord, having folded his robe in four, lay down on his right side in the lion-posture,1017 with one foot on the other, mindful and clearly aware, and bearing in mind the time to arise.
1.6. Now at that time the Nigantha Nātaputta [210] had just died at Pāvā. And at his death the Niganthas were split into two parties, quarrelling and disputing... (as Sutta 29, verse 1). You would have thought they were bent on killing each other. Even the white-robed lay followers were disgusted when they saw that their doctrine and discipline was so ill-proclaimed,... having been proclaimed by one not fully-enlightened and now with its support gone, without an arbiter.
1.7. And the Venerable Sāriputta addressed the monks, referring to this situation, and said: ‘So ill-proclaimed was their teaching and discipline, so unedifyingly displayed, and so ineffectual in calming the passions, having been proclaimed by one who was not fully enlightened. [211] But, friends, this Dhamma has been well proclaimed by the Lord, the fully-enlightened One. And so we should all recite it together 1018 without disagreement, so that this holy life may be enduring and established for a long time, thus to be for the welfare and happiness of the multitude, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare and happiness of devas and humans. And what is this Dhamma that has been well proclaimed by the Lord...?
 
‘There is one thing that was perfectly proclaimed by the Lord who knows and sees, the fully-enlightened Buddha. So we should all recite together...for the benefit, welfare and happiness of devas and humans.

‘These are the [sets of] three things... So we should all recite together...for the benefit, welfare and happiness of devas and humans.’ [221]
 
1.11. ‘There are [sets of] four things which were perfectly proclaimed by the Lord...
(1) ‘Four foundations of mindfulness: Here a monk abides contemplating body as body, ardent, clearly aware and mindful, having put aside hankering and fretting for the world; he abides contemplating feelings as feelings...; he abides contemplating mind as mind...; he abides contemplating mind-objects as mind-objects, ardent, clearly aware and mindful, having put aside hankering and fretting for the world.
(2) ‘Four great efforts (sammappadhānā): Here a monk rouses his will, makes an effort, stirs up energy, exerts his mind and strives to prevent the arising of unarisen evil unwholesome mental states. He rouses his will... and strives to overcome evil unwholesome mental states that have arisen. He rouses his will...and strives to produce unarisen wholesome mental states. He rouses his will...and strives to maintain wholesome mental states that have arisen, not to let them fade away, to bring them to greater growth, to the full perfection of development.
(3) ‘Four roads to power (iddhipādā): Here a monk develops concentration of intention accompanied by effort of will, concentration of energy,... [222] concentration of consciousness, and concentration of investigation accompanied by effort of will.
(4) ‘Four jhānas: Here a monk, detached from all sense-desires, detached from unwholesome mental states, enters and remains in the first jhāna, which is with thinking and pondering, born of detachment, filled with delight and joy. And with the subsiding of thinking and pondering, by gaining inner tranquillity and oneness of mind, he enters and remains in the second jhāna, which is without thinking and pondering, born of concentration, filled with delight and joy. And with the fading away of delight, remaining imperturbable, mindful and clearly aware, he experiences in himself that joy of which the Noble Ones say: “Happy is he who dwells with equanimity and mindfulness”, he enters and remains in the third jhāna. And, having given up pleasure and pain, and with the disappearance of former gladness and sadness, he enters and remains in the fourth jhāna which is beyond pleasure and pain, and purified by equanimity and mindfulness.
(5) ‘Four concentrative meditations (samādhi-bhāvanā). This meditation, when developed and expanded, leads to (a) happiness here and now (ditthadhamma-sukha), (b) gaining knowledge-and-vision (ñāṇa-dassana-paṭilābha), (c) mindfulness and clear awareness (sati-sampajañña), and (d) the destruction of the corruptions (āsavānaṁ khaya). (a) How does this practice lead to happiness here and now? Here, a monk practises the four jhānas. [223] (b) How does it lead to the gaining of knowledge-and-vision? Here, a monk attends to the perception of light (ālokasaññaṁ manasikaroti), he fixes his mind to the perception of day, by night as by day, by day as by night. In this way, with a mind clear and unclouded, he develops a state of mind that is full of brightness (sappabhāsam cittaṁ). (c) How does it lead to mindfulness and clear awareness? Here, a monk knows feelings as they arise, remain and vanish; he knows perceptions as they arise, remain and vanish; he knows thoughts (vitakkā)1057 as they arise, remain and vanish. (d) How does this practice lead to the destruction of the corruptions? Here, a monk abides in the contemplation of the rise and fall of the five aggregates of grasping (pañc’upādānakkhandesu udayabbayânupassi): “This is material form, this is its arising, this is its ceasing; these are feelings...; this is perception...; these are the mental formations...; this is consciousness, this is its arising, this is its ceasing.”
(6) ‘Four boundless states. Here, a monk, with a heart filled with loving-kindness, pervades first one quarter, then the second, the third and the fourth. Thus he stays, [224] spreading the thought of loving-kindness above, below and across, everywhere, always with a heart filled with loving-kindness, abundant, magnified, unbounded, without hatred or ill-will. And likewise with compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity.
(7) ‘Four formless jhānas. Here, a monk, by passing entirely beyond bodily sensations, by the disappearance of all sense of resistance and by non-attraction to the perception of diversity, seeing that space is infinite, reaches and remains in the Sphere of Infinite Space. And by passing entirely beyond the Sphere of Infinite Space, seeing that consciousness is infinite, he reaches and remains in the Sphere of Infinite Consciousness. And by passing entirely beyond the Sphere of Infinite Consciousness, seeing that there is no thing, he reaches and remains in the Sphere of No-Thingness. And by passing entirely beyond the Sphere of No-Thingness, he reaches and remains in the Sphere of Neither-Perception-Nor-Non-Perception.
(8) ‘Four supports 1058 (apassenāni): Here a monk judges that one thing is to be pursued, one thing endured, one thing avoided, one thing suppressed.
(9) ‘Four Ariyan lineages (ariya-υaṁsā). Here, a monk (a) is content with any old robe, praises such contentment, and does not try to obtain robes improperly or unsuitably. He does not worry if he does not get a robe, and if he does, he is not full of greedy, blind desire, but makes use of it, aware of [such] dangers and wisely aware of its true purpose. Nor is he conceited about being thus content with any old robe, and he does not disparage others. And one who is thus skilful, not lax, clearly aware and mindful, [225] is known as a monk who is true to the ancient, original (aggaññe) Ariyan lineage. Again, (b) a monk is content with any alms-food he may get... Again, (c) a monk is content with any old lodging-place ... And again, (d) a monk, being fond of abandoning ( pahāna), rejoices in abandoning, and being fond of developing (bhāυanā), rejoices in developing, is not therefore conceited... And one who is thus skilful, not lax, clearly aware and mindful, is known as a monk who is true to the ancient, original Ariyan lineage.
(10) ‘Four efforts: The effort of (a) restraint (saṁυara-padhānaṁ), (b) abandoning (pahāna-p.), (c) development (bhāυanāp. ), (d) preservation (anurakkhana-p.). What is (a) the effort of restraint? Here, a monk, on seeing an object with the eye, does not grasp at the whole or its details, striving to restrain [226] what might cause evil, unwholesome states, such as hankering or sorrow, to flood in on him. Thus he watches over the sense of sight and guards it (similarly with sounds, smells, tastes, tactile sensations, thoughts). What is (b) the effort of abandoning? Here, a monk does not assent to a thought of lust, of hatred, of cruelty that has arisen, but abandons it, dispels it, destroys it, makes it disappear. What is (c) the effort of development? Here, a monk develops the enlightenment-factor of mindfulness, based on solitude, detachment, extinction, leading to maturity of surrender (vossagga-parināmiṁ); he develops the enlightenment-factor of investigation of states, ... of energy, ... of delight, ... of tranquillity, ... of concentration, ... of equanimity, based on solitude, detachment, extinction, leading to maturity of surrender. What is (d) the effort of preservation? Here, a monk keeps firmly in his mind a favourable object of concentration which has arisen, such as a skeleton, or a corpse that is full of worms, blue-black, full of holes, bloated.
(11) ‘Four knowledges: knowledge of Dhamma, of what is consonant with it (anvaye ñānaṁ), knowledge of others’ minds1059 (paricce ñānaṁ), conventional knowledge1060 (sammuti-ñānaṁ).
(12) [227] ‘Four more knowledges: knowledge of suffering, its origin, its cessation, the path.
(13) ‘Four factors of Stream-Attainment (sotâpattiyangāni): association with good people (sappurisa-saṁseva), hearing the true Dhamma, thorough attention (yoniso manasikāra), practice of the Dhamma in its entirety (dhammânudhamma-patipatti).
(14) ‘Four characteristics of a Stream-Winner: Here, the Ariyan disciple is possessed of unwavering confidence in the Buddha, thus: “This Blessed Lord is an Arahant, a fully-enlightened Buddha, endowed with wisdom and conduct, the Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed, Teachers of gods and humans, enlightened and blessed.” (b) He is possessed of unwavering confidence in the Dhamma, thus: “Well-proclaimed by the Lord is the Dhamma, visible here and now, timeless, inviting inspection, leading onward, to be comprehended by the wise each one for himself.” (c) He is possessed of unwavering confidence in the Sangha, thus: “Well-directed is the Sangha of the Lord’s disciples, of upright conduct, on the right path, on the perfect path; that is to say the four pairs of persons, the eight kinds of men. The Sangha of the Lord’s disciples is worthy of offerings, worthy of hospitality, worthy of gifts, worthy of veneration, an unsurpassed field of merit in the world.” And (d) he is possessed of morality dear to the Noble Ones, unbroken, without defect, unspotted, without inconsistency, liberating, praised by the wise, uncorrupted, and conducive to concentration.
(15) ‘Four fruits of the ascetic life: the fruits of Stream-Entry, of the Once-Returner, of the Non-Returner, of Arahantship. [228]
(16) ‘Four elements: the elements of “earth”, “water”, “fire”, “air” (pathaυῑ-, āpo-, tejo-, vāyo-dhātu).
(17) ‘Four nutriments (āhārā): “material”1061 (kabalinkāra) food, gross or subtle; 1062 contact as second; mental volition (manosañcetanā)1063 as third; consciousness as fourth.
(18) ‘Four stations of consciousness (viññāna-tthitiyo): Consciousness gains a footing either (a) in relation to materiality, with materiality as object and basis, as a place of enjoyment, or similarly in regard to (b) feelings, (c) perceptions or (d) mental formations, and there it grows, increases and flourishes.
(19) ‘Four ways of going wrong (agata-gamanāni): One goes wrong through desire (chanda),1064 hatred, delusion, fear.
(20) ‘Four arousals of craving: Craving arises in a monk because of robes, alms, lodging, being and non-being1065 (iti-bhavâbhava-hetu).

And he gets this thought [240] well-set, well-developed, well raised up, well freed and disconnected from sense-desires.

He sees a rich Khattiya or Brahmin or householder living in full enjoyment of the pleasures of the five senses, and he thinks: “If only when I die I may be reborn as one of these rich people!” He sets his heart on this thought, fixes it and develops it (bhāveti).1116 And this thought, being launched (vimuttaṁ) at such a low level (hīne), and not developed to a higher level (uttarin abhāvitaṁ), leads to rebirth right there. [259] But I say this of a moral person, not of an immoral one. The mental aspiration of a moral person is effective through its purity.1117 Or (b) he gives such gifts and, having heard that the devas in the realm of the Four Great Kings live long, are good-looking and lead a happy life, he thinks: “If only I could be reborn there!” Or he similarly aspires to rebirth in the heavens of (c) the Thirty-Three Gods, (d) the Yama devas, (e) the Tusita devas, (f) the Nimmanarati devas, (g) the Paranimmita-vasavatti devas. And this thought leads to rebirth right there ... The mental aspiration of a moral person is effective through its purity. Or (h) he similarly aspires to rebirth in the world of Brahmā ... But [260] I say this of a moral person, not an immoral one, one freed from passion (vītarāgassa), not one still swayed by passion.1118 The mental aspiration of [such] a moral person is effective through liberation from passion.
(8) ‘Eight assemblies: the assembly of Khattiyas, Brahmins, householders, ascetics, devas of the Realm of the Four Great Kings, of the Thirty-Three Gods, of maras, of Brahmas (as Sutta 16, verse 3.21).
(9) ‘Eight worldly conditions (loka-dhammā): gain and loss, fame and shame (yaso ca ayaso ca), blame and praise, happiness and miserry.
(10) ‘Eight stages of mastery: (a) perceiving forms internally, one sees external forms, limited and beautiful or ugly; (b) (as (a) but) unlimited; (c) not perceiving forms internally, one sees external forms, limited...; (d) (as (c) but) unlimited; not perceiving forms internally, one perceives forms that are (e) blue, [261] (f) yellow, (g) red, (h) white (as Sutta 16, verse 3.25-32).
(11) ‘Eight liberations: (a) possessing form, one sees forms; (b) not perceiving material forms in oneself, one sees them outside; (c) thinking: “It is beautiful”, one becomes intent on it; one enters (d) the Sphere of Infinite Space; (e) ... the Sphere of Infinite Consciousness; (f)... the Sphere of No-Thingness; (g) ... the Sphere of Neither-Perception-Nor-Non-Perception; (h)... the Cessation of Perception and Feeling (as Sutta 15, verse 35). [262]
“These are the [sets of] eight things...’
 
3.2. ‘There are [sets of] nine things...
(1) ‘Nine causes of malice (āghāta-vatthūni): Malice is stirred up by the thought: (a) “He has done me an injury”, (b) “He is doing me an injury”, (c) “He will do me an injury”, (d)-(f) “He has done, is doing, will do an injury to someone who is dear and pleasant to me”, (g) — (i) “he has done, is doing, will do a favour to someone who is hateful and unpleasant to me.”
(2) ‘Nine ways of overcoming malice (āghāta-paṭivinayā): Malice is overcome by the thought: (a) — (i) “He has done me an injury...” (as (1)). [263] “What good would it do [to harbour malice]?”

(4) ‘Nine unfortunate, inopportune times for leading the holy life (akkhaṇā asamayā brahmacariya-vāsāya): [264] (a) A Tathāgata has been born in the world, Arahant, fully-enlightened Buddha, and the Dhamma is taught which leads to calm and perfect Nibbāna, which leads to enlightenment as taught by the Well-Farer, and this person is born in a hell-state (nirayam ),1119...(b)... among the animals, (c) ... among the petas, (d) ... among the asuras, (e) ... in a long-lived group of devas,1120 or (f) he is born in the border regions among foolish barbarians where there is no access for monks and nuns, or male and female lay-followers, or (g) he is born in the Middle Country,1121 but he has wrong views and distorted vision, thinking: “There is no giving, offering or sacrificing, there is no fruit or result of good or bad deeds; there is not this world and the next world; [265] there are no parents and there is no spontaneous rebirth; there are no ascetics and Brahmins in the world who, having attained to the highest and realised for themselves the highest knowledge about this world and the next, proclaim it”; 1122 or (h) ... he is born in the Middle Country but lacks wisdom and is stupid, or is deaf and dumb and cannot tell whether something has been well said or ill said; or else ... (i) no Tathāgata has arisen ... and this person is born in the Middle Country and is intelligent, not stupid, and not deaf or dumb, and well able to tell whether something has been well said or ill said.

‘These are the [sets of] nine things...’
3.3. ‘There are [sets of] ten things perfectly proclaimed by the Lord...
(1) ‘Ten things that give protection (nātha-karana-dhammā): 1124 Here a monk (a) is moral, he lives restrained according to the restraint of the discipline, persisting in right behaviour, seeing danger in the slightest fault, he keeps to the rules of training; [267] (b) he has learnt much, and bears in mind and retains what he has learnt. In these teachings, beautiful in the beginning, the middle and the ending, which in spirit and in letter proclaim the absolutely perfected and purified holy life, he is deeply learned, he remembers them, recites them, recites them, reflects on them and penetrates them with vision; (c) he is a friend, associate and intimate of good people; (d) he is affable, endowed with gentleness and patience, quick to grasp instruction; (e) whatever various jobs there are to be done for his fellow-monks, he is skilful, not lax, using foresight in carrying them out, and is good at doing and planning; (f) he loves the Dhamma and delights in hearing it, he is especially fond of the advanced doctrine and discipline (abhidhamme abhivinaye);1125 [268] (g) he is content with any kind of requisites: robes, alms-food, lodging, medicines in case of illness; (h) he ever strives to arouse energy, to get rid of unwholesome states, to establish wholesome states, untiringly and energetically striving to keep such good states and never shaking off the burden; (i) he is mindful, with a great capacity for clearly recalling things done and said long ago;1126 (j) he is wise, with wise perception of arising and passing away, that Ariyan perception that leads to the complete destruction of suffering.
(2) ‘Ten objects for the attainment of absorption (kasiṇâyatanāni): 1127 He perceives the Earth-Kasina, the Water-Kasina, the Fire-Kasina, the Wind-Kasina, the Blue Kasina, the Yellow Kasina, the Red Kasina, the White Kasina, the Space-Kasina, the Consciousness Kasina,1128 above, below, on all sides, undivided, unbounded.
[269] (3) ‘Ten unwholesome courses of action (akusala-kammapathā): taking life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct, lying speech, slander, rude speech, idle chatter, greed, malevolence, wrong view.
(4) ‘Ten wholesome courses of action: avoidance of taking life...(and so on, as (3) above).
(5) ‘Ten Ariyan dispositions (ariya-vāsā): Here a monk (a) has got rid of five factors, (b) possesses six factors, (c) has established one guard, (d) observes the four supports, (e) has got rid of individual beliefs,1129 (f) has quite abandoned quest, (g) is pure of motive, (h) has tranquillised his emotions,1130 is well liberated (i) in heart, and (j) by wisdom. How has he got rid of five factors? Here, he has got rid of sensuality, ill-will, sloth-and-torpor, worry-and-flurry, and doubt; (b) what six factors does he possess? On seeing an object with the eye, hearing a sound..., smelling a smell..., tasting a flavour... , touching a tangible object..., or cognising a mental object with the mind, he is neither pleased nor displeased, but remains equable, mindful and clearly aware; (c) how has he established the one guard? By guarding his mind with mindfulness; (d) what are the four supports? He judges that one thing is to be pursued, one thing endured, one thing avoided, one thing suppressed (as verse 1.11 (8)); (e) how has he got rid of individual beliefs (panunna-pacceka-sacco)? Whatever individual beliefs are held by the majority of ascetics and Brahmins he has dismissed, abandoned, rejected, let go; (f) how is he one who has quite abandoned quests? He has abandoned the quest for sense-desires, for rebirth, for the holy life;1131 (g) how is he pure of motive? He has abandoned thoughts of sensuality, ill-will, cruelty; (h) how is he one who has tranquillised his emotions (passaddha-kaya-sankhāro hoti)? Because, having given up pleasure and pain with the disappearance of former gladness and sadness, he enters into a state beyond pleasure and pain which is purified by equanimity, and this is the fourth jhāna; (i) how is he well emancipated in heart? He is liberated from the thought of greed, hatred and delusion; (j) how is he well liberated by wisdom? He understands: “For me greed, hatred and delusion are abandoned, cut off at the root, like a palm-tree stump, destroyed and incapable of growing again.” [271]
(6) ‘Ten qualities of the non-learner (asekha):1132 The non-learner’s right view, right thought; right speech, right action, right livelihood; right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration; right knowledge (sammā̵̵-n͂āṇam) , right liberation (sammā̵̵vimutti).
‘These are the [sets of] ten things which have been perfectly set forth by the Lord who knows and sees, the fully-enlightened Buddha. So we should all recite them together without disagreement, so that this holy life may be long-lasting and established for a long time to come, thus to be for the welfare and happiness of the multitude, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare and happiness of devas and humans.’
3.4. And when the Lord had stood up, he said to the Venerable Sariputta: ‘Good, good, Sariputta! Well indeed have you proclaimed the way of chanting together for the monks!’
 
These things were said by the Venerable Sariputta, and the Teacher confirmed them. The monks were delighted and rejoiced at the Venerable Sariputta’s words.
