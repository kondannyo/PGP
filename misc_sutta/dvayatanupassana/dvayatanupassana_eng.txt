12 CONTEMPLATION OF DYADS (DVAYATĀNUPASSANĀ SUTTA)

Thus have I heard.
On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling in Sāvatthī in the Eastern Park in Migāramātā’s mansion.
Now on that occasion — the uposatha day of the fifteenth, the full-moon night — the Blessed One was seated in the open surrounded by the Sangha of bhikkhus.
[140] Then, having surveyed the completely silent Sangha of bhikkhus, he addressed them thus:
“Bhikkhus, if others ask you, ‘What is your aim in listening to those teachings that are wholesome, noble, emancipating, leading to enlightenment?’
you should answer them thus: ‘For the accurate knowledge of things arranged in dyads.’
And what would one call a dyad?

[1. The four noble truths]185
“’This is suffering, this is the origin of suffering’ — this is one contemplation.
‘This is the cessation of suffering, this is the way leading to the cessation of suffering’ — this is a second contemplation.
When a bhikkhu dwells thus correctly contemplating a dyad — heedful, ardent, and resolute — one of two fruits is to be expected of him: either final knowledge in this very life or, if there is a residue remaining, the state of non-returning.”
This is what the Blessed One said.
Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this:

724. “Those who do not understand suffering,  or the origin of suffering;
who do not know where suffering completely ceases without remainder;
and who do not know the path that leads to the allaying of suffering: 
725. “they are destitute of liberation of mind  and also of liberation by wisdom.
Incapable of making an end, they fare on to birth and old age.
726. “But those who understand suffering,  and the origin of suffering;
[who know as well] where suffering
completely ceases without remainder;  and who understand the path  that leads to the allaying of suffering: 
727. “they are possessed of mind’s liberation  and also liberation by wisdom.
Capable of making an end, they fare no more to birth and old age.

[2. Acquisition]
“If, bhikkhus, there are those who ask, ‘Could there be correct contemplation of dyads in some other way?’
you should answer them thus: ‘There could be.’
And how could there be?
‘Whatever suffering originates is all conditioned by acquisition’ — ­this is one contemplation.
‘With the remainderless fading away and cessation of acquisitions, there is no origination of suffering’ — ­this is a second contemplation.
When a bhikkhu dwells thus correctly contemplating a dyad — heedful, ardent, and resolute — one of two fruits is to be expected of him: either final knowledge in this very life or, if there is a residue remaining, the state of non-returning.”
This is what the Blessed One said.
the Teacher further said this:

728. “Sufferings in their many forms in the world originate based on acquisition.
The ignorant dullard who creates acquisition encounters suffering again and again.
Therefore, understanding, one should not create acquisition, contemplating it as the genesis and origin of suffering.

[3. Ignorance]
“If, bhikkhus, there are those who ask, ‘Could there be correct contemplation of dyads in some other way?’
you should answer them thus: ‘There could be.’
And how could there be?
‘Whatever suffering originates is all conditioned by ignorance’ — ­this is one contemplation.
‘With the remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance, there is no origination of suffering’ — this is a second contemplation.
When a bhikkhu dwells thus correctly contemplating a dyad — heedful, ardent, and resolute — one of two fruits is to be expected of him: either final knowledge in this very life or, if there is a residue remaining, the state of non-returning.”
This is what the Blessed One said.
the Teacher further said this:

729. “Those who travel again and again in the saṃsāra of birth and death,
with its becoming thus, becoming otherwise:  that journey is due to ignorance.
730. “It is because of ignorance, this great delusion,  that one has wandered on for so long.
But those beings who have gained clear knowledge do not come back to renewed existence. 

[4. Volitional activities]
“If, bhikkhus, there are those who ask, ‘Could there be correct contemplation of dyads in some other way?’
you should answer them thus: ‘There could be.’
And how could there be?
‘Whatever suffering originates is all conditioned by volitional activities’ — this is one contemplation.
‘With the remainderless fading away and cessation of volitional activities, there is no origination of suffering’ — this is a second contemplation.
When a bhikkhu dwells thus correctly contemplating a dyad — heedful, ardent, and resolute — one of two fruits is to be expected of him: either final knowledge in this very life or, if there is a residue remaining, the state of non-returning.”
This is what the Blessed One said.
the Teacher further said this:

731. “Whatever suffering originates  is all conditioned by volitional activities.
With the cessation of volitional activities, there is no origination of suffering.
732. “When one has known this danger, ‘Suffering is conditioned by volitional activities,’
by the stilling of all volitional activities,  by the stopping of perceptions,
the destruction of suffering occurs when one has known this as it really is.
733. “Seeing rightly, the masters of knowledge, the wise ones, having correctly known this,
overcome the yoke of Māra  and do not come back to renewed existence.

[5. Consciousness]
“If, bhikkhus, there are those who ask, ‘Could there be correct contemplation of dyads in some other way?’
you should answer them thus: ‘There could be.’
And how could there be?
‘Whatever suffering originates is all conditioned by consciousness’ — ­this is one contemplation.
‘With the remainderless fading away and cessation of consciousness, there is no origination of suffering’ — this is a second contemplation.
When a bhikkhu dwells thus correctly contemplating a dyad — heedful, ardent, and resolute — one of two fruits is to be expected of him: either final knowledge in this very life or, if there is a residue remaining, the state of non-returning.”
This is what the Blessed One said.
the Teacher further said this:

734. “Whatever suffering originates  is all conditioned by consciousness.
With the cessation of consciousness, there is no origination of suffering.
735. “Having understood this danger, ‘Suffering is conditioned by consciousness,’
by the stilling of consciousness, a bhikkhu, hungerless, has attained nibbāna.

[6. Contact]
“If, bhikkhus, there are those who ask, ‘Could there be correct contemplation of dyads in some other way?’
you should answer them thus: ‘There could be.’
And how could there be?
‘Whatever suffering originates is all conditioned by contact’ — this is one contemplation.
‘With the remainderless fading away and cessation of contact, there is no origination of suffering’ — this is a second contemplation.
When a bhikkhu dwells thus correctly contemplating a dyad — heedful, ardent, and resolute — one of two fruits is to be expected of him: either final knowledge in this very life or, if there is a residue remaining, the state of non-returning.”
This is what the Blessed One said.
the Teacher further said this:

736. “Those afflicted by contact, flowing along with the stream of existence,
have entered upon a deviant path: the destruction of the fetters is far from them.
737. “But those who have fully understood contact, who, having known it, delight in peace,
by breaking through contact, hungerless, are fully quenched.

[7. Feeling]
“If, bhikkhus, there are those who ask, ‘Could there be correct contemplation of dyads in some other way?’
you should answer them thus: ‘There could be.’
And how could there be?
‘Whatever suffering originates is all conditioned by feeling’ — this is one contemplation.
‘With the remainderless fading away and cessation of feeling, there is no origination of suffering’ — this is a second contemplation.
When a bhikkhu dwells thus correctly contemplating a dyad — heedful, ardent, and resolute — one of two fruits is to be expected of him: either final knowledge in this very life or, if there is a residue remaining, the state of non-returning.”
This is what the Blessed One said.
the Teacher further said this:

738. “Whether it is pleasant or painful  or neither-painful-nor-pleasant,
whatever there is that is felt internally and externally, 
739. “having known, ‘This is suffering,  of a false nature, disintegrating,’
having touched and touched them, seeing their vanishing, one understands them thus.
Through the destruction of feelings, a bhikkhu, hungerless, is fully quenched.

[8. Craving]
“If, bhikkhus, there are those who ask, ‘Could there be correct contemplation of dyads in some other way?’
you should answer them thus: ‘There could be.’
And how could there be?
‘Whatever suffering originates is all conditioned by craving’ — this is one contemplation.
‘With the remainderless fading away and cessation of craving, there is no origination of suffering’ — this is a second contemplation.
When a bhikkhu dwells thus correctly contemplating a dyad — heedful, ardent, and resolute — one of two fruits is to be expected of him: either final knowledge in this very life or, if there is a residue remaining, the state of non-returning.”
This is what the Blessed One said.
the Teacher further said this:

740. “With craving as partner, a person, wandering on this long journey,
does not transcend saṃsāra,  with its becoming thus, becoming otherwise.
741. “Having known this danger, ‘Craving is the origin of suffering,’
a bhikkhu should wander mindfully, free of craving, without grasping.

[9. Clinging]
“If, bhikkhus, there are those who ask, ‘Could there be correct contemplation of dyads in some other way?’
you should answer them thus: ‘There could be.’
And how could there be?
‘Whatever suffering originates is all conditioned by clinging’ — this is one contemplation.
‘With the remainderless fading away and cessation of clinging, there is no origination of suffering’ — this is a second contemplation.
When a bhikkhu dwells thus correctly contemplating a dyad — heedful, ardent, and resolute — one of two fruits is to be expected of him: either final knowledge in this very life or, if there is a residue remaining, the state of non-returning.”
This is what the Blessed One said.
the Teacher further said this:

742. “Existence is conditioned by clinging; an existent being undergoes suffering.
For one who is born there is death; this is the origin of suffering.
743. “Therefore, having correctly understood, having directly known the destruction of birth,
through the destruction of clinging the wise do not come back to renewed existence.

[10. Instigation]
“If, bhikkhus, there are those who ask, ‘Could there be correct contemplation of dyads in some other way?’
you should answer them thus: ‘There could be.’
And how could there be?
‘Whatever suffering originates is all conditioned by instigation’ — ­this is one contemplation.
‘With the remainderless fading away and cessation of instigation, there is no origination of suffering’ — this is a second contemplation.
When a bhikkhu dwells thus correctly contemplating a dyad — heedful, ardent, and resolute — one of two fruits is to be expected of him: either final knowledge in this very life or, if there is a residue remaining, the state of non-returning.”
This is what the Blessed One said.
the Teacher further said this:

744. “Whatever suffering originates  is all conditioned by instigation.
With the cessation of instigation, there is no origination of suffering.
745. “Having known this danger, ‘Suffering is conditioned by instigation,’
having relinquished all instigation, one is liberated in non-instigation.
746. “A bhikkhu with a peaceful mind, who has cut off the craving for existence,
has finished with the wandering on in births; for him there is no renewed existence.

[11. Nutriment]
“If, bhikkhus, there are those who ask, ‘Could there be correct contemplation of dyads in some other way?’
you should answer them thus: ‘There could be.’
And how could there be?
‘Whatever suffering originates is all conditioned by nutriment’ — this is one contemplation.
‘With the remainderless fading away and cessation of nutriment, there is no origination of suffering’ — this is a second contemplation.
When a bhikkhu dwells thus correctly contemplating a dyad — heedful, ardent, and resolute — one of two fruits is to be expected of him: either final knowledge in this very life or, if there is a residue remaining, the state of non-returning.”
This is what the Blessed One said.
the Teacher further said this:

747. “Whatever suffering originates  is all conditioned by nutriment.
With the cessation of nutriment, there is no origination of suffering.
748. “Having known this danger, ‘Suffering is conditioned by nutriment,’
having fully understood all nutriment, one is not attached to any nutriment.
749. “Having correctly understood the state of health  through the utter destruction of the influxes,
using with reflection, firm in the Dhamma, a master of knowledge cannot be designated.

[12. Agitation]
“If, bhikkhus, there are those who ask, ‘Could there be correct contemplation of dyads in some other way?’
you should answer them thus: ‘There could be.’
And how could there be?
‘Whatever suffering originates is all conditioned by agitation’ — this is one contemplation.
‘With the remainderless fading away and cessation of agitation, there is no origination of suffering’ — this is a second contemplation.
When a bhikkhu dwells thus correctly contemplating a dyad — heedful, ardent, and resolute — one of two fruits is to be expected of him: either final knowledge in this very life or, if there is a residue remaining, the state of non-returning.”
This is what the Blessed One said.
the Teacher further said this:

750. “Whatever suffering originates  is all conditioned by agitation.
With the cessation of agitation, there is no origination of suffering.
751. “Having known this danger, ‘Suffering is conditioned by agitation,’
therefore having given up impulse, having put a stop to volitional activities,
without impulse, without clinging, a bhikkhu should wander mindfully.

[13. Dependency]
“If, bhikkhus, there are those who ask, ‘Could there be correct contemplation of dyads in some other way?’
you should answer them thus: ‘There could be.’
And how could there be?
‘For one who is dependent there is quaking’ — this is one contemplation.
‘One who is independent does not quake’ — this is a second contemplation.
When a bhikkhu dwells thus correctly contemplating a dyad — heedful, ardent, and resolute — one of two fruits is to be expected of him: either final knowledge in this very life or, if there is a residue remaining, the state of non-returning.”
This is what the Blessed One said.
the Teacher further said this:

752. “One who is independent does not quake, but one who is dependent, clinging [to things],
does not transcend saṃsāra,  with its becoming thus, becoming otherwise.
753. “Having known this danger, ‘There is great peril in dependencies,’
independent, without clinging, a bhikkhu should wander mindfully.

[14. Form and formless states]
“If, bhikkhus, there are those who ask, ‘Could there be correct contemplation of dyads in some other way?’
you should answer them thus: ‘There could be.’
And how could there be?
‘Formless states are more peaceful than states of form’ — this is one contemplation.
[147] ‘Cessation is more peaceful than formless states’ — this is a second contemplation.
When a bhikkhu dwells thus correctly contemplating a dyad — heedful, ardent, and resolute — one of two fruits is to be expected of him: either final knowledge in this very life or, if there is a residue remaining, the state of non-returning.”
This is what the Blessed One said.
the Teacher further said this:

754. “Those beings who fare on to form  and those who dwell in the formless,
not understanding cessation, come back to renewed existence.
755. “But those who have fully understood forms, without settling down in formless states,
who are liberated in cessation: those people have abandoned death.

[15. Truth and falsity]
“If, bhikkhus, there are those who ask, ‘Could there be correct contemplation of dyads in some other way?’
you should answer them thus: ‘There could be.’
And how could there be?
‘In this world, bhikkhus, with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, among this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, that which is regarded as “This is true,” the noble ones have seen it well with correct wisdom thus: “This is false” ’ — this is one contemplation.
In this world, bhikkhus, with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, among this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, that which is regarded as “This is false,” the noble ones have seen it well with correct wisdom thus: “This is true”’ — this is a second contemplation.
When a bhikkhu dwells thus correctly contemplating a dyad — heedful, ardent, and resolute — one of two fruits is to be expected of him: either final knowledge in this very life or, if there is a residue remaining, the state of non-returning.”
This is what the Blessed One said.
the Teacher further said this:

756. “Behold the world together with its devas conceiving a self in what is non-self.
Settled upon name-and-form, they conceive: ‘This is true.’
757. “In whatever way they conceive it, it turns out otherwise.
That indeed is its falsity, for the transient is of a false nature.
758. “Nibbāna is of a non-false nature:  that the noble ones know as truth.
Through the breakthrough to truth, hungerless, they are fully quenched.

[16. Happiness and suffering]
“If, bhikkhus, there are those who ask, ‘Could there be correct contemplation of dyads in some other way?’
you should answer them thus: ‘There could be.’
And how could there be?
‘In this world, bhikkhus, with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, among this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, that which is regarded as “This is happiness,” the noble ones have seen well with correct wisdom thus: “This is suffering” ’ — this is one contemplation.
In this world, bhikkhus, with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, among this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, that which is regarded as “This is suffering,” the noble ones have seen well with correct wisdom thus, “This is happiness” ’ — this is a second contemplation.
When a bhikkhu dwells thus correctly contemplating a dyad — heedful, ardent, and resolute — one of two fruits is to be expected of him: either final knowledge in this very life, or, if there is a residue of clinging, the state of non-returning.”
This is what the Blessed One said.
Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this:

759. “Forms, sounds, tastes, odors, textures, and objects of mind —
all are desirable, lovely, agreeable, so long as it is said: ‘They are.’
760. “These are considered as happiness in the world with its devas;
but where these cease,  that they consider suffering.
761. “The noble ones have seen as happiness the ceasing of the personal entity.
Running counter to the entire world  is this [insight] of those who see.
762. “What others speak of as happiness,  that the noble ones speak of as suffering.
What others speak of as suffering,  that the noble ones have known as happiness.
Behold this Dhamma hard to comprehend: here the foolish are bewildered. 
763. “There is gloom for those who are blocked, darkness for those who do not see,
but for the good it is opened up like light for those who see.
The brutes unskilled in the Dhamma do not understand it even when close.
764. “This Dhamma is not easily understood by those afflicted by lust for existence,
by those flowing in the stream of existence, deeply mired in Māra’s realm.
765. “Who else apart from the noble ones are able to understand this state?
When they have correctly known that state, those without influxes attain nibbāna.”

This is what the Blessed One said.
Elated, those bhikkhus delighted in the Blessed One’s statement.
And while this discourse was being spoken, the minds of sixty bhikkhus were liberated from the influxes by non-clinging.
