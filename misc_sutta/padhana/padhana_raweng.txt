2 STRIVING (PADHĀNA SUTTA)

425. “When, resolved upon striving,

I had gone to the Nerañjarā River,

as I was meditating very strenuously

to attain security from bondage, (1)

426. “Namucī approached me,

speaking compassionate words:

‘You are thin, pale;

you’re on the verge of death. (2)

427. “ ‘A thousand parts belong to death,

one fraction of your life remains.

Live, sir, life is better!

While living, make merits! (3) [75]

428. “ ‘While you are living the spiritual life

and performing the fire sacrifice,

abundant merit is stored up.

Why devote yourself to striving? (4)

429. “ ‘Hard to travel is the path for striving,

hard to practice, hard to achieve.’ ”

Speaking these verses, Māra stood

in the presence of the Buddha. (5)

430. When Māra had spoken in such a way,

the Blessed One said this to him:

“Kinsman of the heedless, Evil One,

you have come here with a purpose. (6)

431. “I do not have any need

even for the slightest merit.124

It is fitting for Māra to speak

to those who have need of merits. (7)

432. “I have faith and energy too,

and wisdom exists in me.

When I am so resolute,

why do you ask me to live? (8)

433. “This wind might dry up

even the streams of the rivers,

so why, when I am resolute,

should it not dry up my blood? (9)

434. “When the blood is drying up,

the bile and phlegm dry up.

When my muscles are wasting away,

my mind becomes even more serene,

and my mindfulness and wisdom

and concentration become more firm. (10)

435. “While I am dwelling in such a way

I have experienced extreme pain,

yet my mind does not turn to sensual pleasures:

behold the purity of the being! (11) [76]

436. “Sensual pleasures are your first army;

the second is called discontent.

Hunger and thirst are the third;

the fourth is called craving. (12)

437. “The fifth is dullness and drowsiness;

the sixth is called cowardice.

Doubt is your seventh;

your eighth, denigration and pride. (13)

438. “Gain, praise, and honor,

and wrongly obtained fame [is ninth];

[the tenth is when] one extols oneself

and looks down at others. (14)

439. “This is your army, Namucī,

the squadron of the Dark One.

A weakling does not conquer it,

but having conquered it, one gains bliss. (15)

440. “I wear muñja grass;

wretched would life be to me.125

It’s better that I die in battle

than live on defeated. (16)

441. “Some ascetics and brahmins,

engulfed here, are no longer seen.

They do not know the path by which

the disciplined ones travel. (17)

442. “Having seen the bannered army all around,

[and] Māra with his vehicle ready,

I will go out to meet him in battle:

may he not dislodge me from my place! (18)

443. “Though the world with its devas

cannot overcome that army of yours, [77]

I will destroy126 it with wisdom,

like a fresh clay bowl with a stone. (19)

444. “Having gained mastery over my intention,

and with mindfulness well established,

I will wander from realm to realm,

guiding many disciples. (20)

445. “Heedful and resolute,

those practitioners of my teaching,

against your wishes, will go

to the state where one does not sorrow.” (21)

446. “For seven years I followed the Blessed One,

[trailing him] step by step,

but I have not found an opening

in the Enlightened One, who is mindful. (22)

447. “There was a crow that circled around

a stone that looked like a lump of fat:

‘Perhaps we’ll find something tender here;

perhaps there may be something tasty.’ (23)

448. “But finding nothing tasty there,

the crow departed from that place.

Just like the crow that attacked the stone,

we leave Gotama disappointed.” (24) [78]

449. So much was he stricken with sorrow

that his lute fell from his armpit.

Thereupon that saddened spirit

disappeared right on the spot. (25)
