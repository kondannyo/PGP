(Edited for alignment with Pali)
Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in the darkness so those with good eyesight can see forms.

Master Gotama, just as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown,
revealing what was hidden,
showing the way to one who was lost,
or holding up a lamp in the darkness so,
'those with good eyesight could see form.'
In this same way, Master Gotama, has made the Dhamma clear in many ways.
