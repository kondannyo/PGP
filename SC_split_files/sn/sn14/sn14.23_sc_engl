At Sāvatthī. 
“Mendicants, sentient beings come together and converge because of an element: 
the faithless with the faithless … 
shameless … 
imprudent … 
lacking immersion … 
witless … 
The faithful with the faithful … 
conscientious … 
prudent... 
possessing immersion … 
and the wise with the wise.”
