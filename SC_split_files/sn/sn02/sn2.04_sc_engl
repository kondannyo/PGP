1. The First Chapter 
4. With Māghadha 
At Sāvatthī. 
Standing to one side, the god Māgadha addressed the Buddha in verse: 
“How many lamps are there, 
to shine their light on the world? 
We’ve come to ask the Buddha; 
how are we to understand this?” 
“There are four lamps in the world, 
a fifth is not found. 
The sun shines by day, 
the moon glows at night, 
while a fire burns both 
by day and by night. 
But a Buddha is the best of lights: 
this is the supreme radiance.”
