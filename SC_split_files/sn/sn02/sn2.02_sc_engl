1. The First Chapter 
2. With Kassapa (2nd) 
At Sāvatthī. 
Standing to one side, the god Kassapa recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Suppose a mendicant is a meditator, freed in mind. 
# NOTE: I take the phrase as a poetic abbreviation of the stock hadayassa santi
If they want to reach the heart’s peace, 
having known the arising and passing of the world, 
healthy-minded, independent, that is their reward.”
