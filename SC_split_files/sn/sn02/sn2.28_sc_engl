28. With Nandivisāla 
Standing to one side, the god Nandivisāla addressed the Buddha in verse: 
“Four are its wheels, and nine its doors; 
it’s filled with greed and tied up; 
and it’s born from a bog. Great hero, 
how am I supposed to live like this?” 
“Having cut the strap and harness—
wicked desire and greed—
and having plucked out craving, root and all: 
that’s how you’re supposed to live like this.”
