27. With Nanda 
Standing to one side, the god Nanda recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Time flies, nights pass by, 
the stages of life leave us one by one. 
Seeing this peril in death, 
you should do good deeds that bring happiness.” 
“Time flies, nights pass by, 
the stages of life leave us one by one. 
Seeing this peril in death, 
one looking for peace would drop the world’s bait.”
