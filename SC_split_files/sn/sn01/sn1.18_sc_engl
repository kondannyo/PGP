2. The Garden of Delight 
18. Conscience 
“Can a person constrained by conscience 
be found in the world? 
# NOTE: See BB for the highly uncertain reading.
Who shies away from blame, 
like a fine horse from the whip?” 
“Few are those constrained by conscience, 
who live always mindful. 
Having reached the end of suffering, 
they live smoothly in the rough.”
