4. Time Flies 
At Sāvatthī. 
Standing to one side, that deity recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Time flies, nights pass by, 
the stages of life abandon us one by one. 
Seeing this peril in death, 
do good deeds that bring you to joy.” 
“Time flies, nights pass by, 
the stages of life abandon us one by one. 
Seeing this peril in death, 
a seeker of peace would drop the world’s bait.”
