43. Food 
“Both gods and humans 
enjoy their food. 
So what’s the name of the spirit 
who doesn’t like food?” 
“Those who give with faith 
and a clear and confident heart, 
partake of food 
in this world and the next. 
So you should dispel stinginess, 
overcoming that stain, and give a gift. 
The good deeds of sentient beings 
support them in the next world.”
