53. A Friend 
“Who’s your friend abroad? 
Who’s your friend at home? 
Who’s your friend in need? 
Who’s your friend in the next life?” 
“A caravan is your friend abroad. 
Mother is your friend at home. 
A comrade in a time of need 
is a friend time and again. 
But the good deeds you’ve done yourself—
that’s your friend in the next life.”
