13. There’s Nothing Like a Child 
At Sāvatthī. 
Standing to one side, that deity recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
“There’s no love like that for a child, 
no wealth equal to cattle, 
no light like that of the sun, 
and of waters the ocean is paramount.” 
“There’s no love like that for oneself, 
no wealth equal to grain, 
no light like that of wisdom, 
and of waters the rain is paramount.”
