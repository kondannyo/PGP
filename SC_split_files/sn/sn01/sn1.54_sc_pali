Saṃyutta Nikāya 1 
6. Jarāvagga 
54. Vatthusutta 
# NOTE: I think the underlying metaphor here is more concrete than “support”: it is a person’s lands, their property, which is their support and legacy. As usual, the Buddha’s response aims to upend conventional values.
“Kiṃsu vatthu manussānaṃ, 
kiṃsūdha paramo sakhā; 
Kiṃsu bhūtā upajīvanti, 
ye pāṇā pathavissitā”ti. 
“Puttā vatthu manussānaṃ, 
bhariyā ca paramo sakhā; 
Vuṭṭhiṃ bhūtā upajīvanti, 
ye pāṇā pathavissitā”ti.
