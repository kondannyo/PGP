1. A Reed 
8. Very Confused 
At Sāvatthī. 
Standing to one side, that deity recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Those who are very confused about the teachings, 
who may be led astray by the doctrines of others; 
asleep, they have not woken up: 
it is time for them to wake!” 
“Those who are unconfused about the teachings, 
who won’t be led astray by the doctrines of others; 
they’ve woken up, they rightly know, 
they live smoothly in the rough.”
