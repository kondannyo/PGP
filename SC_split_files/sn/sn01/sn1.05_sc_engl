1. A Reed 
5. Cut How Many? 
At Sāvatthī. 
Standing to one side, that deity recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Cut how many? Drop how many? 
How many more should be developed? 
How many kinds of clinging must a mendicant get over 
before you call them a flood-crosser?” 
“Five to cut, five to drop, 
and five more to develop. 
A mendicant must get over five kinds of clinging 
before you call them a flood-crosser.”
