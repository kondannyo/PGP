Saṃyutta Nikāya 1 
6. Jarāvagga 
51. Jarāsutta 
# NOTE: BB’s “until” suggests to me that sila is only good until you get old, which is surely not what was meant!
“Kiṃsu yāva jarā sādhu, 
kiṃsu sādhu patiṭṭhitaṃ; 
Kiṃsu narānaṃ ratanaṃ, 
kiṃsu corehi dūharan”ti. 
“Sīlaṃ yāva jarā sādhu, 
saddhā sādhu patiṭṭhitā; 
Paññā narānaṃ ratanaṃ, 
puññaṃ corehi dūharan”ti.
