24. Shielding the Mind 
“Whatever you’ve shielded the mind from 
can’t cause you suffering. 
So you should shield the mind from everything, 
then you’re freed from all suffering.” 
“You needn’t shield the mind from everything. 
# NOTE: See BB for readings.
When the mind is under control, 
you need only shield the mind 
from where the bad things come.”
