2. A Stream-Enterer (1st) 
“Mendicants, there are these five faculties. 
What five? 
The faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom. 
A noble disciple comes to truly understand these five faculties’ gratification, drawback, and escape. 
Such a noble disciple is called a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.”
