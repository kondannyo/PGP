4. The Pleasure Faculty 
32. A Stream-Enterer 
“Mendicants, there are these five faculties. 
What five? 
The faculties of pleasure, pain, happiness, sadness, and equanimity. 
A noble disciple comes to truly understand these five faculties’ origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape. 
Such a noble disciple is called a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.”
