“Mendicants, there are these five faculties. 
What five? 
The faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom. 
These are the five faculties. 
Someone who has completed and fulfilled these five faculties is a perfected one. If they are weaker than that, they’re a non-returner. If they are weaker still, they’re a once-returner. If they are weaker still, they’re a stream-enterer. If they’re weaker still, they’re a follower of the teachings. If they’re weaker still, they’re a follower by faith.”
