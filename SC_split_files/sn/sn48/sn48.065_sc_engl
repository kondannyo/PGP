65. Two Fruits 
“Mendicants, there are these five faculties. 
What five? 
The faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom. 
These are the five faculties. 
Because of developing and cultivating these five faculties, one of two results can be expected: 
enlightenment in the present life, or if there’s something left over, non-return.”
