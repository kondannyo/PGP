2. Weaker 
20. The Ending of Defilements 
“Mendicants, there are these five faculties. 
What five? 
The faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom. 
These are the five faculties. 
It’s because of developing and cultivating these five faculties that a mendicant realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.”
