14. Burning Chaff 
146. Full of Disillusionment 
At Sāvatthī. 
“Mendicants, when a gentleman has gone forth out of faith, this is what’s in line with the teachings. 
They should live full of disillusionment for form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. 
Living in this way, they completely understand form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. 
Completely understanding form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness, they’re freed from these things. They’re freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They’re freed from suffering, I say.”
