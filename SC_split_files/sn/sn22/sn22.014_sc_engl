2. Impermanence 
14. Not-Self 
At Sāvatthī. 
“Mendicants, form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are not-self. 
Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. 
Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed. 
They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’”
