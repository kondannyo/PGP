11. Sides 
109. A Stream-Enterer 
At Sāvatthī. 
“Mendicants, there are these five grasping aggregates. 
What five? 
That is, the grasping aggregates of form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. 
A noble disciple comes to truly understand these five grasping aggregates’ origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape. 
Such a noble disciple is called a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.”
