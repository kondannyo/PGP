42. In Line with the Teachings (4th) 
At Sāvatthī. 
“Mendicants, when a mendicant is practicing in line with the teachings, this is what’s in line with the teachings. They should live observing not-self in form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. … 
They’re freed from suffering, I say.”
