1. Corruptions 
3. Consciousness 
At Sāvatthī. 
“Mendicants, desire and greed for eye consciousness, 
ear consciousness, 
nose consciousness, 
tongue consciousness, 
body consciousness, 
or mind consciousness is a corruption of the mind. 
When a mendicant has given up mental corruption in these six cases, their mind inclines to renunciation. 
A mind imbued with renunciation is declared to be capable of directly knowing anything that can be realized.”
