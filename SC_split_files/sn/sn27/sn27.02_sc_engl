Linked Discourses 27 
1. Corruptions 
2. Sights 
At Sāvatthī. 
“Mendicants, desire and greed for sights, 
sounds, 
smells, 
tastes, 
touches, 
or thoughts is a corruption of the mind. 
When a mendicant has given up mental corruption in these six cases, their mind inclines to renunciation. 
A mind imbued with renunciation is declared to be capable of directly knowing anything that can be realized.”
