4. In a Rosewood Forest 
31. In a Rosewood Forest 
# NOTE: The simsapa is identified with Dalbergia sissoo, known as “North Indian Rosewood”. Since they’re in north India, I think just plain “rosewood” will do fine.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambī in a rosewood forest. 
Then the Buddha picked up a few rosewood leaves in his hand and addressed the mendicants: 
“What do you think, mendicants? 
Which is more: 
the few leaves in my hand, or those in the forest above me?” 
“Sir, the few leaves in your hand are a tiny amount. 
There are far more leaves in the forest above.” 
# NOTE: Following PTS, and apparently all manuscripts except the Burmese, which have appamattakam akkhatam
“In the same way, there is much more that I have directly known but have not explained to you. What I have explained is a tiny amount. 
And why haven’t I explained it? 
Because it’s not beneficial or relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life. It doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. 
That’s why I haven’t explained it. 
And what have I explained? 
I have explained: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’. 
And why have I explained this? 
Because it’s beneficial and relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life. It leads to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. 
That’s why I’ve explained it. 
That’s why you should practice meditation …”
