2. About Māra (2nd) 
17. Not-Self 
At Sāvatthī. 
Seated to one side, Venerable Rādha said to the Buddha: 
“Sir, they speak of this thing called ‘not-self’. 
What is not-self?” 
“Rādha, form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are not-self. 
Seeing this … 
They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’”
