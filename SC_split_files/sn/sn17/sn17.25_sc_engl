3. The Third Chapter 
25. Ascetics and Brahmins 
At Sāvatthī. 
“Mendicants, there are ascetics and brahmins who don’t truly understand the gratification, drawback, and escape when it comes to possessions, honor, and popularity. 
I don’t regard them as true ascetics and brahmins. Those venerables don’t realize the goal of life as an ascetic or brahmin, and don’t live having realized it with their own insight.
