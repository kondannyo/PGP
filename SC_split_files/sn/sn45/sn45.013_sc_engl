13. A Trainee 
At Sāvatthī. 
Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha … and asked him, 
“Sir, they speak of this person called ‘a trainee’. 
How is a trainee defined?” 
“Mendicant, it’s someone who has a trainee’s right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. 
That’s how a trainee is defined.”
