At Sāvatthī. 
“Mendicants, there are these four floods. 
What four? 
The floods of sensuality, desire to be reborn, views, and ignorance. 
These are the four floods. 
The noble eightfold path should be developed for the direct knowledge, complete understanding, finishing, and giving up of these four floods.”
