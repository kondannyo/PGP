174. Personal Ties 
“Mendicants, there are these four ties. 
What four? 
The personal ties to covetousness, ill will, misapprehension of precepts and observances, and the insistence that this is the only truth. 
These are the four ties. 
The noble eightfold path should be developed for the direct knowledge, complete understanding, finishing, and giving up of these four ties.”
