“Mendicants, there are these four attachments. 
What four? 
The attachment to sensual pleasures, future lives, views, and ignorance. 
These are the four attachments. 
The noble eightfold path should be developed for the direct knowledge, complete understanding, finishing, and giving up of these four attachments.”
