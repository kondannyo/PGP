16. Purified (1st) 
At Sāvatthī. 
“Mendicants, these eight things don’t arise to be purified, bright, flawless, and rid of corruptions except when a Realized One, a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha has appeared. 
What eight? 
They are: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. 
These eight things don’t arise to be purified, bright, flawless, and rid of corruptions except when a Realized One, a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha has appeared.”
