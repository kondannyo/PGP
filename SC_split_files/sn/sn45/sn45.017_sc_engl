At Sāvatthī. 
“Mendicants, these eight things don’t arise to be purified, bright, flawless, and rid of corruptions apart from the Holy One’s training. 
What eight? 
They are: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. 
These eight things don’t arise to be purified, bright, flawless, and rid of corruptions apart from the Holy One’s training.”
