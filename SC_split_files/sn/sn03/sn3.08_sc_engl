1. Shackles 
8. With Queen Mallikā 
At Sāvatthī. 
Now at that time King Pasenadi of Kosala was upstairs in the stilt longhouse together with Queen Mallikā. 
Then the king said to the queen, 
“Mallikā, is there anyone more dear to you than yourself?” 
“No, great king, there isn’t. 
But is there anyone more dear to you than yourself?” 
“For me also, Mallikā, there’s no-one.” 
Then King Pasenadi of Kosala came downstairs from the stilt longhouse, went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.

Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha recited this verse: 
“Having explored every quarter with the mind, 
one finds no-one dearer than oneself. 
Likewise for others, each holds themselves dear. 
So one who loves themselves would not harm others.”
