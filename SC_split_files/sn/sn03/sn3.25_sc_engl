3. Kosala 
25. The Simile of the Mountain 
At Sāvatthī. 
King Pasenadi of Kosala sat to one side, and the Buddha said to him, 
“So, great king, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?” 
“Sir, there are anointed aristocratic kings who are infatuated with authority, and obsessed with greed for sensual pleasures. They have attained stability in the country, occupying a vast conquered territory. Today I have been busy fulfilling the duties of such kings.” 
“What do you think, great king? 
Suppose a trustworthy and reliable man were to come from the east. 
He’d approach you and say: 
‘Please sir, you should know this. I come from the east. 
There I saw a huge mountain that reached the clouds. And it was coming this way, crushing all creatures. 
So then, great king, do what you must!’ 
Then a second trustworthy and reliable man were to come from the west … 
a third from the north … 
and a fourth from the south. 
He’d approach you and say: 
‘Please sir, you should know this. I come from the south. 
There I saw a huge mountain that reached the clouds. And it was coming this way, crushing all creatures. 
So then, great king, do what you must!’ 
Should such a dire threat arise—a terrible loss of human life, when human birth is so rare—what would you do?” 
“Sir, what could I do but practice the teachings, practice morality, doing skillful and good actions?” 
“I tell you, great king, I announce to you: old age and death are advancing upon you. 
Since old age and death are advancing upon you, what would you do?” 
“Sir, what can I do but practice the teachings, practice morality, doing skillful and good actions? 
Sir, there are anointed aristocratic kings who are infatuated with authority, and obsessed with greed for sensual pleasures. They have attained stability in the country, occupying a vast conquered territory. Such kings engage in battles of elephants,

cavalry, 
chariots, 
or infantry. 
But there is no place, no scope for such battles when old age and death are advancing. 
In this royal court there are ministers of wise counsel who are capable of dividing an approaching enemy by wise counsel. 
But there is no place, no scope for such diplomatic battles when old age and death are advancing. 
# NOTE: bhumigata and vehasattha are stock in this phrase. they’re explained in Pj2 as “underground” (assuming that bhumigata and bhumatta are synonyms) and “above the ground”.
In this royal court there is abundant gold coin and bullion stored in dungeons and towers. Using this wealth we can pay off an approaching enemy. 
But there is no place, no scope for such monetary battles when old age and death are advancing. 
When old age and death are advancing, what can I do but practice the teachings, practice morality, doing skillful and good actions?” 
“That’s so true, great king! That’s so true! 
When old age and death are advancing, what can you do but practice the teachings, practice morality, doing skillful and good actions?” 
That is what the Buddha said. 
Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: 
“Suppose there were vast mountains 
of solid rock touching the sky 
drawing in from all sides 
and crushing the four quarters. 
So too old age and death 
advance upon all living creatures—
aristocrats, brahmins, merchants, 
workers, outcastes, and scavengers. 
They spare nothing. 
They crush all beneath them. 
There’s nowhere for elephants to take a stand, 
nor chariots nor infantry. 
They can’t be defeated 
by diplomatic battles or by wealth. 
That’s why an astute person, 
seeing what’s good for themselves, 
being wise, would place faith 
in the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha. 
Whoever lives by the teaching 
in body, speech, and mind, 
is praised in this life 
and departs to rejoice in heaven.”
