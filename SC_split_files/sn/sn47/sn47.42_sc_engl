42. Origin 
“Mendicants, I will teach you the origin and the ending of the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. 
Listen … 
And what is the origin of the body? 
The body originates from food. 
When food ceases, the body ends. 
Feelings originate from contact. 
When contact ceases, feelings end. 
The mind originates from name and form. 
When name and form cease, the mind ends. 
Principles originate from attention. 
When focus ends, principles end.”
