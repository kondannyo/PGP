32. Skillful (2nd) 
“Mendicants, whatever qualities are skillful, part of the skillful, on the side of the skillful, all of them are rooted in proper attention and meet at proper attention, and proper attention is said to be the best of them. 
A mendicant accomplished in proper attention can expect to develop and cultivate the seven awakening factors. 
And how does a mendicant with proper attention develop and cultivate the seven awakening factors? 
It’s when a mendicant develops the awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion, and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go. 
That’s how a mendicant with proper attention develops and cultivates the seven awakening factors.”
