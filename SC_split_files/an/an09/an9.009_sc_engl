1. Awakening 
9. Persons 
“Mendicants, these nine people are found in the world. 
What nine? 
The perfected one and the one practicing for perfection. The non-returner and the one practicing to realize the fruit of non-return. The once-returner and the one practicing to realize the fruit of once-return. The stream-enterer and the one practicing to realize the fruit of stream-entry. And the ordinary person. 
These are the nine people found in the world.”
