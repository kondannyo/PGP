4. The Great Chapter 
32. Progressive Meditations 
“Mendicants, there are these nine progressive meditations. 
What nine? 
The first absorption, the second absorption, the third absorption, the fourth absorption, the dimension of infinite space, the dimension of infinite consciousness, the dimension of nothingness, the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, and the cessation of perception and feeling. 
These are the nine progressive meditations.”
