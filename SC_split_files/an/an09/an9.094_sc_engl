“For insight into greed, nine things should be developed. 
What nine? 
The first absorption, the second absorption, the third absorption, the fourth absorption, the dimension of infinite space, the dimension of infinite consciousness, the dimension of nothingness, the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, and the cessation of perception and feeling. 
For insight into greed, these nine things should be developed.”
