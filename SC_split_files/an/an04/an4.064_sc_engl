Numbered Discourses 4 
7. Deeds of Substance 
64. Hell 
“Mendicants, someone with four qualities is cast down to hell. 
What four? 
They kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, and lie. 
Someone with these four qualities is cast down to hell. 
Killing, stealing, 
telling lies, 
and visiting others’ wives: 
astute people don’t praise these things.”
