“For insight into greed, four things should be developed. 
What four? 
Firstly, a mendicant generates enthusiasm, tries, makes an effort, exerts the mind, and strives so that bad, unskillful qualities don’t arise. 
…so that unskillful qualities that have arisen are given up … so that skillful qualities arise … so that skillful qualities that have arisen remain, are not lost, but increase, mature, and are fulfilled by development. 
For insight into greed, these four things should be developed.”
