“Mendicants, a mendicant with six qualities soon acquires great and abundant good qualities. 
What six? 
It’s when a mendicant is full of light, full of practice, full of inspiration, and full of eagerness. They don’t slack off when it comes to developing skillful qualities. They reach further. 
A mendicant who has these six qualities soon acquires great and abundant good qualities.”
