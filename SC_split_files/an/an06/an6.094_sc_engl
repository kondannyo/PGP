94. Things That Can’t Be Done (3rd) 
“Mendicants, these six things can’t be done. 
What six? 
A person accomplished in view can’t murder their mother or father or a perfected one. They can’t maliciously shed the blood of the Realized One. They can’t cause a schism in the Saṅgha. They can’t acknowledge another teacher. 
These are the six things that can’t be done.”
