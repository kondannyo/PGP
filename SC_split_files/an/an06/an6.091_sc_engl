91. Can’t Give Rise 
“Mendicants, a person accomplished in view can’t give rise to six things.

Identity view, doubt, misapprehension of precepts and observances, and forms of greed, hate, and delusion that lead to rebirth in places of loss. 
A person accomplished in view can’t give rise to these six things.”
