“Mendicants, these seven people are worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and are the supreme field of merit for the world. 
What seven? 
The one freed both ways, the one freed by wisdom, the personal witness, the one attained to view, the one freed by faith, the follower of the teachings, and the follower by faith. 
These are the seven people who are worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and are the supreme field of merit for the world.”
