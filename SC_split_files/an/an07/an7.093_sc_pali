Aṅguttara Nikāya 7 
9. Samaṇavagga 
93. Asaddhammasutta 
“Sattime, bhikkhave, asaddhammā. 
Katame satta? 
# NOTE: Lacking the expected ekacco or bhikkhu, etc., it seems these terms are to be taken as substantives, hence BB’s “seven who are not of good character”. However the same list at DN 33 has “idhāvuso, bhikkhu assaddho hoti”. I take this as the correct reading and translate accordingly.
Assaddho hoti, ahiriko hoti, anottappī hoti, appassuto hoti, kusīto hoti, muṭṭhassati hoti, duppañño hoti. 
Ime kho, bhikkhave, satta asaddhammā”ti. 
Navamaṃ.
