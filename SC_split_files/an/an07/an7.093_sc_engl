Numbered Discourses 7 
9. An Ascetic 
93. Bad Qualities 
“Mendicants, there are these seven bad qualities. 
What seven? 
# NOTE: Lacking the expected ekacco or bhikkhu, etc., it seems these terms are to be taken as substantives, hence BB’s “seven who are not of good character”. However the same list at DN 33 has “idhāvuso, bhikkhu assaddho hoti”. I take this as the correct reading and translate accordingly.
Someone is faithless, shameless, imprudent, uneducated, lazy, unmindful, and witless. 
These are the seven bad qualities.”
