“Mendicants, for insight into greed, seven things should be developed. 
What seven? 
The perception of impermanence, the perception of not-self, the perception of ugliness, the perception of drawbacks, the perception of giving up, the perception of fading away, and the perception of cessation. 
These seven things should be developed for insight into greed.”
