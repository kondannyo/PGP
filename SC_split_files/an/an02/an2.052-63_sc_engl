“Mendicants, I will teach you about living with bad people and living with good people. 
Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 
“Yes, sir,” they replied. 
The Buddha said this: 
“What is it like living with bad people? How do bad people live together? 
It’s when a senior mendicant thinks: 
‘No mendicant, whether senior, middle, or junior, should admonish me; 
and I shouldn’t admonish any mendicant, whether senior, middle, or junior. 
If a mendicant—whether senior, middle, or junior—were to admonish me, they wouldn’t be sympathetic, and I’d bother them by saying “No!” And anyway I wouldn’t deal with it even if I saw what I did wrong.’

And a middle or a junior mendicant also thinks: 
‘No mendicant, whether senior, middle, or junior, should admonish me; 
and I shouldn’t admonish any mendicant, whether senior, middle, or junior. 
If a mendicant—whether senior, middle, or junior—were to admonish me, they wouldn’t be sympathetic, and I’d bother them by saying “No!” And anyway I wouldn’t deal with it even if I saw what I did wrong.’

That’s what it’s like living with bad people; that’s how bad people live together. 
What is it like living with good people? How do good people live together? 
It’s when a senior mendicant thinks: 
‘Any mendicant, whether senior, middle, or junior, should admonish me; 
and I should admonish any mendicant, whether senior, middle, or junior. 
If a mendicant—whether senior, middle, or junior—were to admonish me, they’d be sympathetic, so I wouldn’t bother them, but say “Thank you!” And I’d deal with it when I saw what I did wrong.’

And a middle or a junior mendicant also thinks:

# NOTE: Var readings vacisamhara, vacisamsara, vacisankhara: MN 103 Comm: Vacīsaṃhāroti vacanasañcāro. Imehi kathitaṃ amūsaṃ antaraṃ paveseyya, tumhe imehi idañcidañca vuttāti amūhi kathitaṃ imesaṃ antaraṃ paveseyyāti attho, Tika: Vacanasañcāroti pesuññavasena aññathāvacanupasaṃhāro. The parallel passage is at AN 2.63, where samsara is the MS reading, and adopted by BB there. Comm there gives a completely different explanation: ubhato vacīsaṃsāroti dvīsupi pakkhesu aññamaññaṃ akkosanapaccakkosanavasena saṃsaramānā vācā vacīsaṃsāro. Tika has: Saṃsaramānāti pavattamānā. Despite this, I think the reading samhara makes better sense, as per MN comm.
“In a disciplinary issue, when the tale-bearing on both sides—with contempt for each other’s views, resentful, bitter, and exasperated—is not settled internally, you can expect that this disciplinary issue will be 
long, fractious, and troublesome, and the mendicants won’t live comfortably. 
In a disciplinary issue, when the tale-bearing on both sides—with contempt for each other’s views, resentful, bitter, and exasperated—is well settled internally, you can expect that this disciplinary issue 
won’t lead to lasting acrimony and enmity, and the mendicants will live comfortably.”
