30. Mindfulness of the Body 
575 
“Mendicants, anyone who brings into their mind the great ocean includes all of the streams that run into it. 
In the same way, anyone who has developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body includes all of the skillful qualities that play a part in realization.” 
576–582 
# NOTE: Yogakkhema is a hard idiom to get right. I agree with the theory of Witzel, who traces it to an “oasis”, deriving from the very old days of the Indo-euopean wanderers. They’d trudge through the desert and hardlands, and after a very long time they’d come to a lake, an oasis, with grass for the cattle and horses, and shade and water. There they’d stop for the night, make a safe place, and find relief both for themselves and their beasts. This meaning is still prominent in the Jatakas, where a number of the old, mythic Jatakas features a lake Khema that is a sanctuary for living creatures. I translate directly as sanctuary, and use “sanctuary from the yoke” or similar when need in context.
“One thing, mendicants, when developed and cultivated leads to great urgency … great benefit … great sanctuary … mindfulness and awareness … gaining knowledge and vision … blissful meditation in the present life … the realization of the fruit of knowledge and freedom. 
What one thing?

“When one thing, mendicants, is developed and cultivated, ignorance is given up, knowledge arises, the conceit ‘I am’ is given up, the underlying tendencies are uprooted, and the fetters are given up.

When this one thing is developed and cultivated, ignorance is given up, knowledge arises, the conceit ‘I am’ is given up, the underlying tendencies are uprooted, and the fetters are given up.”
