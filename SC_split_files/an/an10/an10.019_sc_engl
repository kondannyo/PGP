2. A Protector 
19. Abodes of the Noble Ones (1st) 
“There are these ten noble abodes in which the noble ones of the past, present, and future abide. 
What ten? 
A mendicant has given up five factors, is endowed with six factors, has a single guard, has four supports, has eliminated idiosyncratic interpretations of the truth, has totally given up searching, has pure intentions, has stilled the physical process, and is well freed in mind and well freed by wisdom. 
These are the ten noble abodes in which the noble ones of the past, present, and future abide.”
