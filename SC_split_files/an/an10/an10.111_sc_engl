Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 
“Sir, they speak of this person called ‘an adept’. 
How is an adept mendicant defined?” 
“Mendicant, it’s when a mendicant has an adept’s right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right immersion, right knowledge, and right freedom. 
That’s how a mendicant is an adept.”
