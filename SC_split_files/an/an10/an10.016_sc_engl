2. A Protector 
16. Worthy of Offerings Dedicated to the Gods 
“Mendicants, these ten people are worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and are the supreme field of merit for the world. 
What ten? 
A Realized One, a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha; a Buddha awakened for themselves; one freed both ways; one freed by wisdom; a personal witness; one attained to view; one freed by faith; a follower by faith; a follower of the teachings; a member of the spiritual family. 
These are the ten people who are worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and are the supreme field of merit for the world.”
