19. Wilderness Dwellers 
183. Dwelling at the Root of a Tree 
“Mendicants, there are these five kinds of people who dwell at the root of a tree. 
What five? 
A person may dwell at the root of a tree because of stupidity … bad desires … madness … because it is praised by the Buddhas … or for the sake of having few wishes … 
These are the five kinds of people who dwell at the root of a tree.”
