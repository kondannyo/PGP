93. Declarations 
“Mendicants, there are five ways of declaring enlightenment. 
What five? 
One declares enlightenment out of stupidity and folly. 
Or because of wicked desires, being naturally full of desires. 
Or because of madness and mental disorder. 
Or out of overestimation. 
Or one declares enlightenment rightly. 
These are the five ways of declaring enlightenment.”
