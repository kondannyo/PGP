“Mendicants, a woman or a man, a layperson or a renunciate should often review these five subjects. 
What five? 
‘I am liable to grow old, I am not exempt from old age.’ A woman or a man, a layperson or a renunciate should often review this. 
‘I am liable to get sick, I am not exempt from sickness.’ … 
‘I am liable to die, I am not exempt from death.’ … 
‘I must be parted and separated from all I hold dear and beloved.’ … 
‘I am the owner of my deeds and heir to my deeds. Deeds are my womb, my relative, and my refuge. 
I shall be the heir of whatever deeds I do, whether good or bad.’ 
A woman or a man, a layperson or a renunciate should often review this. 
What is the advantage for a woman or a man, a layperson or a renunciate of often reviewing this: ‘I am liable to grow old, I am not exempt from old age’? 
# NOTE: BB renders “yobbane yobbanamado “as” in their youth … intoxicated with their youth”, and so with the subsequent sections. However this is problematic in meaning: do old people not do stupid things infatuated with youth? The same idiom occurs at AN 3.39, where BB renders “intoxicated with youth”. In other words, he reads the locative as locative of reference, lit. “with regards to youth, intoxicated with youth”, which in this case is best left implicit. I follow this approach in both cases.
There are sentient beings who, intoxicated with the vanity of youth, do bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. 
Reviewing this subject often, they entirely give up the vanity of youth, or at least reduce it.

Then that noble disciple reflects: 
‘It’s not just me who is liable to grow old, not being exempt from old age. For all sentient beings grow old according to their nature, as long as they come and go, pass away and are reborn.’ 
When they review this subject often, the path is born in them. 
They cultivate, develop, and make much of it. 
By doing so, they give up the fetters and eliminate the underlying tendencies.

For others, sickness is natural, 
and so are old age and death. 
Though this is how their nature is, 
ordinary people feel disgusted. 
If I were to be disgusted 
with creatures whose nature is such, 
it would not be appropriate for me, 
since my life is just the same. 
Living in such a way, 
I understood the reality without attachments. 
I mastered all vanities—
of health, of youth, 
and even of life—
seeing safety in renunciation. 
Zeal sprang up in me 
as I looked to extinguishment. 
Now I’m unable 
to indulge in sensual pleasures; 
there’s no turning back, 
until the spiritual life is complete.”
