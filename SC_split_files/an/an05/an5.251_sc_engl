26. Ordination 
251. Who Should Give Ordination 
“Mendicants, ordination should be given by a mendicant with five qualities. 
What five? 
It’s a mendicant who has the entire spectrum of an adept’s ethics, 
immersion, 
wisdom, 
freedom, 
and the knowledge and vision of freedom. 
Ordination should be given by a mendicant with these five qualities.”
