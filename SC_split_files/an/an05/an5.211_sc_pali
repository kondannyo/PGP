Aṅguttara Nikāya 5 
22. Akkosakavagga 
211. Akkosakasutta 
“Yo so, bhikkhave, bhikkhu akkosakaparibhāsako ariyūpavādī sabrahmacārīnaṃ, tassa pañca ādīnavā pāṭikaṅkhā. 
Katame pañca? 
# NOTE: chinnaparipantha is apparently unique. BB has “cuts of the outlet”. But paripantha has no attested meaning as “outlet”. The PTS dict does mention this, and gives a couple of refs, but it seems to be mistaken, as neither of these in fact support the reading. Nor is that meaning found in MW: http://sanskritdictionary.com/?iencoding=iast&q=paripantha&lang=sans&action=Search But if we take the normal meaning of paripantha, how is a parajika to “cut off the obstacle”. I propose reading as a dvanda: chinno paripantho. Also note that in this passage the vā only is used for the first three items, which might suggest the last two were added.
Pārājiko vā hoti chinnaparipantho, aññataraṃ vā saṃkiliṭṭhaṃ āpattiṃ āpajjati, bāḷhaṃ vā rogātaṅkaṃ phusati, sammūḷho kālaṃ karoti, kāyassa bhedā paraṃ maraṇā apāyaṃ duggatiṃ vinipātaṃ nirayaṃ upapajjati. 
Yo so, bhikkhave, bhikkhu akkosakaparibhāsako ariyūpavādī sabrahmacārīnaṃ, tassa ime pañca ādīnavā pāṭikaṅkhā”ti. 
Paṭhamaṃ.
