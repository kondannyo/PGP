184. Charnel Ground Dwellers 
“Mendicants, there are these five kinds of people who dwell in a charnel ground. 
What five? 
A person may dwell in a charnel ground because of stupidity … bad desires … madness … because it is praised by the Buddhas … or for the sake of having few wishes … 
These are the five kinds of people who dwell in a charnel ground.”
