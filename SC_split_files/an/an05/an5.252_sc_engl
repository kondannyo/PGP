252. Who Should Give Dependence 
“Mendicants, dependence should be given by a mendicant with five qualities. 
What five? 
It’s a mendicant who has the entire spectrum of an adept’s ethics, immersion, wisdom, freedom, and the knowledge and vision of freedom. 
Dependence should be given by a mendicant with these five qualities.”
