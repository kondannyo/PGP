Long Discourses 1 
The Prime Net 
1. Talk on Wanderers 
So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was traveling along the road between Rājagaha and Nālanda together with a large Saṅgha of around five hundred mendicants. 
The wanderer Suppiya was also traveling along the same road, together with his pupil, the brahmin student Brahmadatta. 
Meanwhile, Suppiya criticized the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha in many ways, 
but his pupil Brahmadatta praised them in many ways. 
And so both teacher and pupil followed behind the Buddha and the Saṅgha of mendicants directly contradicting each other. 
Then the Buddha took up residence for the night in the royal rest-house in Ambalaṭṭhikā together with the Saṅgha of mendicants. 
And Suppiya and Brahmadatta did likewise. 
There too, Suppiya criticized the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha in many ways, 
but his pupil Brahmadatta praised them in many ways. 
And so both teacher and pupil kept on directly contradicting each other. 
# NOTE: saṅkhiyadhamma is a unique term, occurring, so far as I can tell, nowhere else in the Pali literature. The commentary glosses as kathadhamma, and thus Bodhi and Thanissaro effectively just have it as 'conversation". Rhys Davids followed by Wals have something like "trend of conversation." Yet it seems to me that such a unique term in such a prominent position should have a more specific maning. I am not aware of elsewhere in the ENTs where sankya has the plain sense "conversation". rather, it is connected with the notion of evaluation, measuring. Here the subject of discussion is the different ways the two parties evaluate the Sangha.
Then several mendicants rose at the crack of dawn and sat together in the pavilion, where the topic of evaluation came up: 
“It’s incredible, reverends, it’s amazing how the diverse attitudes of sentient beings have been clearly comprehended by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. 
For this Suppiya criticizes the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha in many ways, 
while his pupil Brahmadatta praises them in many ways. 
And so both teacher and pupil followed behind the Buddha and the Saṅgha of mendicants directly contradicting each other.” 
When the Buddha found out about this discussion on evaluation among the mendicants, he went to the pavilion, where he sat on the seat spread out and addressed the mendicants, 
“Mendicants, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?” 
The mendicants told him what had happened, adding,

“This was our conversation that was unfinished when the Buddha arrived.” 
# NOTE: I think this passage is more gently critical of the monks than implied in previous translations. The phrasing here is somewhat unusual and specific, and is more active than just “giving way”: they “should not do” what creates bitterness (i.e. sit around judging others). Cp MN 22, where the same phrases are used. In the Buddha’s case, it has the neutral hoti, while for the mendicants it uses karaniya, as here.
“Mendicants, if others criticize me, the teaching, or the Saṅgha, don’t make yourselves resentful, bitter, and exasperated. 
You’ll get angry and upset, which would be an obstacle for you alone. 
If others were to criticize me, the teaching, or the Saṅgha, and you got angry and upset, would you be able to understand whether they spoke well or poorly?” 
“No, sir.” 
“If others criticize me, the teaching, or the Saṅgha, you should explain that what is untrue is in fact untrue: 
‘This is why that’s untrue, this is why that’s false. There’s no such thing in us, it’s not found among us.’ 
If others praise me, the teaching, or the Saṅgha, don’t make yourselves thrilled, elated, and excited. 
You’ll get thrilled, elated, and excited, which would be an obstacle for you alone. 
If others praise me, the teaching, or the Saṅgha, you should acknowledge that what is true is in fact true: 
‘This is why that’s true, this is why that’s correct. There is such a thing in us, it is found among us.’ 
2. Ethics 
2.1. The Shorter Section on Ethics 
When an ordinary person speaks praise of the Realized One, they speak only of trivial, insignificant details of mere ethics.

2.3. The Large Section on Ethics 
# NOTE: Translations of tiracchana in such contexts (debased, low, etc.) are often harsher than the old explanations. In Bhi pc 49-50, we have Tiracchā­na­vijjā nāma yaṃ kiñci bāhirakaṃ anat­tha­saṃhi­taṃ, while the commentary says Tiracchānavijjā nāma aniyyānikattā saggamokkhamaggānaṃ tiracchānabhūtā.

3. Views 
3.1. Theories About the Past 
There are other principles—deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of reason, subtle, comprehensible to the astute—which the Realized One makes known after realizing them with his own insight. Those who genuinely praise the Realized One would rightly speak of these things. 
And what are these principles? 
There are some ascetics and brahmins who theorize about the past, and assert various hypotheses concerning the past on eighteen grounds. 
And what are the eighteen grounds on which they rely? 
3.1.1. Eternalism 
There are some ascetics and brahmins who are eternalists, who assert that the self and the cosmos are eternal on four grounds. 
And what are the four grounds on which they rely? 
It’s when some ascetic or brahmin—by dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right focus—experiences an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect their many kinds of past lives. 
That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the cosmos contracting, many eons of the cosmos expanding, many eons of the cosmos contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details. 
They say: 
‘The self and the cosmos are eternal, barren, steady as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar. 
They remain the same for all eternity, while these sentient beings wander and transmigrate and pass away and rearise. 
Why is that? 
Because by dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right focus I experience an immersion of the heart of such a kind that I recollect my many kinds of past lives, 
with features and details. 
Because of this I know: 
“The self and the cosmos are eternal, barren, steady as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar. 
They remain the same for all eternity, while these sentient beings wander and transmigrate and pass away and rearise.’ 
This is the first ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely to assert that the self and the cosmos are eternal. 
And what is the second ground on which they rely? 
It’s when some ascetic or brahmin—by dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right focus—experiences an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect their many kinds of past lives. 
That is: one eon of the cosmos contracting and expanding; two, three, four, five, or ten eons of the cosmos contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended.

This is the second ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely to assert that the self and the cosmos are eternal. 
And what is the third ground on which they rely? 
It’s when some ascetic or brahmin—by dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right focus—experiences an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect their many kinds of past lives. 
That is: ten eons of the cosmos contracting and expanding; twenty, thirty, or forty eons of the cosmos contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food.

This is the third ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely to assert that the self and the cosmos are eternal. 
And what is the fourth ground on which they rely? 
It’s when some ascetic or brahmin relies on logic and inquiry. They speak of what they have worked out by logic, following a line of inquiry, expressing their own perspective: 
‘The self and the cosmos are eternal, barren, steady as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar. 
They remain the same for all eternity, while these sentient beings wander and transmigrate and pass away and rearise.’ 
This is the fourth ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely to assert that the self and the cosmos are eternal. 
These are the four grounds on which those ascetics and brahmins assert that the self and the cosmos are eternal. 
# NOTE: I have my doubts about this phrase: in every other occurrence, ito bahiddha means “outside of the Buddhist community”. Still, comm and the Chinese text at T21 agree on this sense.
Any ascetics and brahmins who assert that the self and the cosmos are eternal do so on one or other of these four grounds. Outside of this there is none. 
The Realized One understands this: 
‘If you hold on to and attach to these grounds for views it leads to such and such a destiny in the next life.’ 
He understands this, and what goes beyond this. Yet since he does not misapprehend that understanding, he has realized extinguishment within himself. 
Having truly understood the origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape from feelings, the Realized One is freed through not grasping. 
These are the principles—deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of reason, subtle, comprehensible to the astute—which the Realized One makes known after realizing them with his own insight. And those who genuinely praise the Realized One would rightly speak of these things.

3.1.2. Partial Eternalism 
There are some ascetics and brahmins who are partial eternalists, who assert that the self and the cosmos are partially eternal and partially not eternal on four grounds. 
And what are the four grounds on which they rely? 
There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, this cosmos contracts. 
As the cosmos contracts, sentient beings are mostly headed for the realm of streaming radiance. 
There they are mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, moving through the sky, steadily glorious, and they remain like that for a very long time. 
There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, this cosmos expands. 
As it expands an empty mansion of Brahmā appears. 
Then a certain sentient being—due to the running out of their life-span or merit—passes away from that host of radiant deities and is reborn in that empty mansion of Brahmā. 
There they are mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, moving through the sky, steadily glorious, and they remain like that for a very long time. 
But after staying there all alone for a long time, they become dissatisfied and anxious: 
‘Oh, if only another being would come to this state of existence.’ 
Then other sentient beings—due to the running out of their life-span or merit—pass away from that host of radiant deities and are reborn in that empty mansion of Brahmā in company with that being. 
There they too are mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, moving through the sky, steadily glorious, and they remain like that for a very long time. 
Now, the being who was reborn there first thinks: 
‘I am Brahmā, the Great Brahmā, the Undefeated, the Champion, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, the Lord God, the Maker, the Author, the Best, the Begetter, the Controller, the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be born. 
These beings were created by me! 
Why is that? 
Because first I thought: 
“Oh, if only another being would come to this state of existence.” 
# NOTE: Correlation and causation!
Such was my heart’s wish, and then these creatures came to this state of existence.’ 
And the beings who were reborn there later also think: 
‘This must be Brahmā, the Great Brahmā, the Undefeated, the Champion, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, the Lord God, the Maker, the Author, the Best, the Begetter, the Controller, the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be born. 
And we have been created by him. 
Why is that? 
Because we see that he was reborn here first, and we arrived later.’ 
And the being who was reborn first is more long-lived, beautiful, and illustrious than those who arrived later. 
{}
It’s possible that one of those beings passes away from that host and is reborn in this state of existence. 
Having done so, they go forth from the lay life to homelessness. 
By dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right focus, they experience an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect that past life, but no further. 
They say: 
‘He who is Brahmā—the Great Brahmā, the Undefeated, the Champion, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, the Lord God, the Maker, the Author, the Best, the Begetter, the Controller, the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be born—is permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, remaining the same for all eternity. 
We who were created by that Brahmā are impermanent, not lasting, short-lived, perishable, and have come to this state of existence. 
This is the first ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely to assert that the self and the cosmos are partially eternal. 
And what is the second ground on which they rely? 
There are gods named ‘depraved by play.’ They spend too much time laughing, playing, and making merry. And in doing so, they lose their mindfulness, and they pass away from that host of gods. 
It’s possible that one of those beings passes away from that host and is reborn in this state of existence. 
Having done so, they go forth from the lay life to homelessness. 
By dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right focus, they experience an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect that past life, but no further. 
They say: 
‘The gods not depraved by play don’t spend too much time laughing, playing, and making merry. So they don’t lose their mindfulness, and don’t pass away from that host of gods. 
They are permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, remaining the same for all eternity. 
But we who were depraved by play spent too much time laughing, playing, and making merry. In doing so, we lost our mindfulness, and passed away from that host of gods. 
We are impermanent, not lasting, short-lived, perishable, and have come to this state of existence.’ 
This is the second ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely to assert that the self and the cosmos are partially eternal. 
And what is the third ground on which they rely? 
# NOTE: The parallel with khiddapadosika rather confuses the issue, suggesting a rendering “depraved in mind” here. However elsewhere in the suttas, manopadosa consistently means “malicious intent”, MN 56, MN 93, also see mano padūseyya at MN 21 and MN 28. Thus the contrast here would seem to be greed vs hate. Also note DN 26, “tesaṃ sattānaṃ aññamaññamhi tibbo āghāto paccupaṭṭhito bhavissati tibbo byāpādo tibbo manopadoso tibbaṃ vadhakacittaṃ.”
There are gods named ‘malevolent’. They spend too much time gazing at each other, so they grow angry with each other, and their bodies and minds get tired. They pass away from that host of gods. 
It’s possible that one of those beings passes away from that host and is reborn in this state of existence. 
Having done so, they go forth from the lay life to homelessness. 
By dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right focus, they experience an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect that past life, but no further. 
They say: 
‘The gods who are not malevolent don’t spend too much time gazing at each other, so they don’t grow angry with each other, their bodies and minds don’t get tired, and they don’t pass away from that host of gods. 
They are permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, remaining the same for all eternity. 
But we who were malevolent spent too much time gazing at each other, we grew angry with each other, our bodies and minds got tired, and we passed away from that host of gods. 
We are impermanent, not lasting, short-lived, perishable, and have come to this state of existence.’ 
This is the third ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely to assert that the self and the cosmos are partially eternal. 
And what is the fourth ground on which they rely? 
It’s when some ascetic or brahmin relies on logic and inquiry. They speak of what they have worked out by logic, following a line of inquiry, expressing their own perspective: 
‘That which is called “the eye” or “the ear” or “the nose” or “the tongue” or “the body”: that self is impermanent, not lasting, transient, perishable. 
That which is called “mind” or “sentience” or “consciousness”: that self is permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, remaining the same for all eternity.’ 
This is the fourth ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely to assert that the self and the cosmos are partially eternal. 
These are the four grounds on which those ascetics and brahmins assert that the self and the cosmos are partially eternal and partially not eternal. 
Any ascetics and brahmins who assert that the self and the cosmos are partially eternal and partially not eternal do so on one or other of these four grounds. Outside of this there is none. 
The Realized One understands this: 
‘If you hold on to and attach to these grounds for views it leads to such and such a destiny in the next life.’ 
He understands this, and what goes beyond this. Yet since he does not misapprehend that understanding, he has realized extinguishment within himself. 
Having truly understood the origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape from feelings, the Realized One is freed through not grasping. 
These are the principles—deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of reason, subtle, comprehensible to the astute—which the Realized One makes known after realizing them with his own insight. And those who genuinely praise the Realized One would rightly speak of these things. 
3.1.3. The Cosmos is Finite or Infinite 
There are some ascetics and brahmins who theorize about size, and assert that the cosmos is finite or infinite on four grounds. 
And what are the four grounds on which they rely? 
It’s when some ascetic or brahmin—by dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right focus—experiences an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they meditate perceiving the cosmos as finite. 
They say: 
‘The cosmos is finite and bounded. 
Why is that? 
Because by dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right focus I experience an immersion of the heart of such a kind that I meditate perceiving the cosmos as finite. 
Because of this I know: 
“The cosmos is finite and bounded.”’ 
This is the first ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely to assert that the cosmos is finite or infinite. 
And what is the second ground on which they rely? 
It’s when some ascetic or brahmin—by dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right focus—experiences an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they meditate perceiving the cosmos as infinite. 
They say: 
‘The cosmos is infinite and unbounded. 
The ascetics and brahmins who say that 
the cosmos is finite are wrong. 
The cosmos is infinite and unbounded. 
Why is that? 
Because by dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right focus I experience an immersion of the heart of such a kind that I meditate perceiving the cosmos as infinite. 
Because of this I know: 
“The cosmos is infinite and unbounded.”’ 
This is the second ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely to assert that the cosmos is finite or infinite. 
And what is the third ground on which they rely? 
It’s when some ascetic or brahmin—by dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right focus—experiences an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they meditate perceiving the cosmos as finite vertically but infinite horizontally. 
They say: 
‘The cosmos is both finite and infinite. 
The ascetics and brahmins who say that 
the cosmos is finite are wrong, 
and so are those who say that 
the cosmos is infinite. 
The cosmos is both finite and infinite. 
Why is that? 
Because by dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right focus I experience an immersion of the heart of such a kind that I meditate perceiving the cosmos as finite vertically but infinite horizontally. 
Because of this I know: 
“The cosmos is both finite and infinite.”’ 
This is the third ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely to assert that the cosmos is finite or infinite. 
And what is the fourth ground on which they rely? 
It’s when some ascetic or brahmin relies on logic and inquiry. They speak of what they have worked out by logic, following a line of inquiry, expressing their own perspective: 
‘The cosmos is neither finite nor infinite. 
The ascetics and brahmins who say that 
the cosmos is finite are wrong, 
as are those who say that 
the cosmos is infinite, 
and also those who say that 
the cosmos is both finite and infinite. 
The cosmos is neither finite nor infinite.’ 
This is the fourth ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely to assert that the cosmos is finite or infinite. 
These are the four grounds on which those ascetics and brahmins assert that the cosmos is finite or infinite. 
Any ascetics and brahmins who assert that the cosmos is finite or infinite do so on one or other of these four grounds. Outside of this there is none. 
The Realized One understands this: 
‘If you hold on to and attach to these grounds for views it leads to such and such a destiny in the next life.’ 
He understands this, and what goes beyond this. Yet since he does not misapprehend that understanding, he has realized extinguishment within himself. 
Having truly understood the origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape from feelings, the Realized One is freed through not grasping. 
These are the principles—deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of reason, subtle, comprehensible to the astute—which the Realized One makes known after realizing them with his own insight. And those who genuinely praise the Realized One would rightly speak of these things. 
3.1.4. Equivocators 
There are some ascetics and brahmins who are equivocators. Whenever they’re asked a question, they resort to evasiveness and equivocation on four grounds. 
And what are the four grounds on which they rely? 
It’s when some ascetic or brahmin doesn’t truly understand what is skillful and what is unskillful. 
They think: 
‘I don’t truly understand what is skillful and what is unskillful. 
If I were to declare that something was skillful or unskillful I might be wrong. 
That would be stressful for me, 
and that stress would be an obstacle.’ 
So from fear and disgust with false speech they avoid stating whether something is skillful or unskillful. Whenever they’re asked a question, they resort to evasiveness and equivocation: 
‘I don’t say it’s like this. I don’t say it’s like that. I don’t say it’s otherwise. I don’t say it’s not so. And I don’t deny it’s not so.’ 
This is the first ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely when resorting to evasiveness and equivocation. 
And what is the second ground on which they rely? 
It’s when some ascetic or brahmin doesn’t truly understand what is skillful and what is unskillful. 
They think: 
‘I don’t truly understand what is skillful and what is unskillful. 
If I were to declare that something was skillful or unskillful I might feel desire or greed or hate or repulsion. 
That would be grasping on my part. 
That would be stressful for me, 
and that stress would be an obstacle.’ 
So from fear and disgust with grasping they avoid stating whether something is skillful or unskillful. Whenever they’re asked a question, they resort to evasiveness and equivocation: 
‘I don’t say it’s like this. I don’t say it’s like that. I don’t say it’s otherwise. I don’t say it’s not so. And I don’t deny it’s not so.’ 
This is the second ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely when resorting to evasiveness and equivocation. 
And what is the third ground on which they rely? 
It’s when some ascetic or brahmin doesn’t truly understand what is skillful and what is unskillful. 
They think: 
‘I don’t truly understand what is skillful and what is unskillful. 
Suppose I were to declare that something was skillful or unskillful. 
There are clever ascetics and brahmins who are subtle, accomplished in the doctrines of others, hair-splitters. You’d think they live to demolish convictions with their intellect. 
They might pursue, press, and grill me about that. 
I’d be stumped by such a grilling. 
That would be stressful for me, 
and that stress would be an obstacle.’ 
So from fear and disgust with examination they avoid stating whether something is skillful or unskillful. Whenever they’re asked a question, they resort to evasiveness and equivocation: 
‘I don’t say it’s like this. I don’t say it’s like that. I don’t say it’s otherwise. I don’t say it’s not so. And I don’t deny it’s not so.’ 
This is the third ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely when resorting to evasiveness and equivocation. 
And what is the fourth ground on which they rely? 
It’s when some ascetic or brahmin is dull and stupid. 
Because of that, whenever they’re asked a question, they resort to evasiveness and equivocation: 
‘Suppose you were to ask me whether there is another world. If I believed there was, I would say so. 
But I don’t say it’s like this. I don’t say it’s like that. I don’t say it’s otherwise. I don’t say it’s not so. And I don’t deny it’s not so. 
Suppose you were to ask me whether there is no other world … 
whether there both is and is not another world … 
whether there neither is nor is not another world … 
whether there are beings who are reborn spontaneously … 
whether there are not beings who are reborn spontaneously … 
whether there both are and are not beings who are reborn spontaneously … 
whether there neither are nor are not beings who are reborn spontaneously … 
whether there is fruit and result of good and bad deeds … 
whether there is not fruit and result of good and bad deeds … 
whether there both is and is not fruit and result of good and bad deeds … 
whether there neither is nor is not fruit and result of good and bad deeds … 
whether a Realized One exists after death … 
whether a Realized One doesn’t exist after death … 
whether a Realized One both exists and doesn’t exist after death … 
whether a Realized One neither exists nor doesn’t exist after death. If I believed there was, I would say so. 
But I don’t say it’s like this. I don’t say it’s like that. I don’t say it’s otherwise. I don’t say it’s not so. And I don’t deny it’s not so.’ 
This is the fourth ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely when resorting to evasiveness and equivocation. 
These are the four grounds on which those ascetics and brahmins who are equivocators resort to evasiveness and equivocation whenever they’re asked a question. 
Any ascetics and brahmins who resort to equivocation do so on one or other of these four grounds. Outside of this there is none. 
The Realized One understands this … 
And those who genuinely praise the Realized One would rightly speak of these things. 
3.1.5. Doctrines of Origination by Chance 
There are some ascetics and brahmins who theorize about chance. They assert that the self and the cosmos arose by chance on two grounds. 
And what are the two grounds on which they rely? 
There are gods named ‘non-percipient beings’. 
When perception arises they pass away from that host of gods. 
It’s possible that one of those beings passes away from that host and is reborn in this state of existence. 
Having done so, they go forth from the lay life to homelessness. 
By dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right focus, they experience an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect the arising of perception, but no further. 
They say: 
‘The self and the cosmos arose by chance. 
Why is that? 
Because formerly I didn’t exist. Now, having not been, I’ve sprung into existence.’ 
This is the first ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely to assert that the self and the cosmos arose by chance. 
And what is the second ground on which they rely? 
It’s when some ascetic or brahmin relies on logic and inquiry. 
They speak of what they have worked out by logic, following a line of inquiry, expressing their own perspective: 
‘The self and the cosmos arose by chance.’ 
This is the second ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely to assert that the self and the cosmos arose by chance. 
These are the two grounds on which those ascetics and brahmins who theorize about chance assert that the self and the cosmos arose by chance. 
Any ascetics and brahmins who theorize about chance do so on one or other of these two grounds. Outside of this there is none. 
The Realized One understands this … 
And those who genuinely praise the Realized One would rightly speak of these things. 
These are the eighteen grounds on which those ascetics and brahmins who theorize about the past assert various hypotheses concerning the past. 
Any ascetics and brahmins who theorize about the past do so on one or other of these eighteen grounds. Outside of this there is none. 
The Realized One understands this: 
‘If you hold on to and attach to these grounds for views it leads to such and such a destiny in the next life.’ 
He understands this, and what goes beyond this. Yet since he does not misapprehend that understanding, he has realized extinguishment within himself. 
Having truly understood the origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape from feelings, the Realized One is freed through not grasping. 
These are the principles—deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of reason, subtle, comprehensible to the astute—which the Realized One makes known after realizing them with his own insight. And those who genuinely praise the Realized One would rightly speak of these things.

3.2. Theories About the Future 
There are some ascetics and brahmins who theorize about the future, and assert various hypotheses concerning the future on forty-four grounds. 
And what are the forty-four grounds on which they rely? 
3.2.1. Percipient Life After Death 
There are some ascetics and brahmins who say there is life after death, and assert that the self lives on after death in a percipient form on sixteen grounds. 
And what are the sixteen grounds on which they rely? 
They assert: ‘The self is sound and percipient after death, and it is physical … 
non-physical … 
both physical and non-physical … 
neither physical nor non-physical … 
finite … 
infinite … 
both finite and infinite … 
neither finite nor infinite … 
of unified perception … 
of diverse perception … 
of limited perception … 
of limitless perception … 
experiences nothing but happiness … 
experiences nothing but suffering … 
experiences both happiness and suffering … 
experiences neither happiness nor suffering.’ 
These are the sixteen grounds on which those ascetics and brahmins assert that the self lives on after death in a percipient form. 
Any ascetics and brahmins who assert that the self lives on after death in a percipient form do so on one or other of these sixteen grounds. Outside of this there is none. 
The Realized One understands this … 
And those who genuinely praise the Realized One would rightly speak of these things. 
3.2.2. Non-Percipient Life After Death 
There are some ascetics and brahmins who say there is life after death, and assert that the self lives on after death in a non-percipient form on eight grounds. 
And what are the eight grounds on which they rely? 
They assert: ‘The self is sound and non-percipient after death, and it is physical … 
non-physical … 
both physical and non-physical … 
neither physical nor non-physical … 
finite … 
infinite … 
both finite and infinite … 
neither finite nor infinite.’ 
These are the eight grounds on which those ascetics and brahmins assert that the self lives on after death in a non-percipient form. 
Any ascetics and brahmins who assert that the self lives on after death in a non-percipient form do so on one or other of these eight grounds. Outside of this there is none. 
The Realized One understands this … 
And those who genuinely praise the Realized One would rightly speak of these things. 
3.2.3. Neither Percipient Nor Non-Percipient Life After Death 
There are some ascetics and brahmins who say there is life after death, and assert that the self lives on after death in a neither percipient nor non-percipient form on eight grounds. 
And what are the eight grounds on which they rely? 
They assert: ‘The self is sound and neither percipient nor non-percipient after death, and it is physical … 
non-physical … 
both physical and non-physical … 
neither physical nor non-physical … 
finite … 
infinite … 
both finite and infinite … 
neither finite nor infinite.’ 
These are the eight grounds on which those ascetics and brahmins assert that the self lives on after death in a neither percipient nor non-percipient form. 
Any ascetics and brahmins who assert that the self lives on after death in a neither percipient nor non-percipient form do so on one or other of these eight grounds. Outside of this there is none. 
The Realized One understands this … 
And those who genuinely praise the Realized One would rightly speak of these things. 
3.2.4. Annihilationism 
There are some ascetics and brahmins who are annihilationists. They assert the annihilation, eradication, and obliteration of an existing being on seven grounds. 
And what are the seven grounds on which they rely? 
There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view: 
‘This self is physical, made up of the four primary elements, and produced by mother and father. Since it’s annihilated and destroyed when the body breaks up, and doesn’t exist after death, that’s how this self becomes rightly annihilated.’ 
That is how some assert the annihilation of an existing being. 
But someone else says to them: 
‘*That* self of which you speak does exist, I don’t deny it. 
But that’s not how *this* self becomes rightly annihilated. 
There is another self that is divine, physical, sensual, consuming solid food. 
You don’t know or see that. 
But I know it and see it. 
Since this self is annihilated and destroyed when the body breaks up, and doesn’t exist after death, that’s how this self becomes rightly annihilated.’ 
That is how some assert the annihilation of an existing being. 
But someone else says to them: 
‘*That* self of which you speak does exist, I don’t deny it. 
But that’s not how *this* self becomes rightly annihilated. 
There is another self that is divine, physical, mind-made, complete in all its various parts, not deficient in any faculty. 
You don’t know or see that. 
But I know it and see it. 
Since this self is annihilated and destroyed when the body breaks up, and doesn’t exist after death, that’s how this self becomes rightly annihilated.’ 
That is how some assert the annihilation of an existing being. 
But someone else says to them: 
‘*That* self of which you speak does exist, I don’t deny it. 
But that’s not how *this* self becomes rightly annihilated. 
There is another self which has gone totally beyond perceptions of form. With the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that “space is infinite”, it’s reborn in the dimension of infinite space. 
You don’t know or see that. 
But I know it and see it. 
Since this self is annihilated and destroyed when the body breaks up, and doesn’t exist after death, that’s how this self becomes rightly annihilated.’ 
That is how some assert the annihilation of an existing being. 
But someone else says to them: 
‘*That* self of which you speak does exist, I don’t deny it. 
But that’s not how *this* self becomes rightly annihilated. 
There is another self which has gone totally beyond the dimension of infinite space. Aware that “consciousness is infinite”, it’s reborn in the dimension of infinite consciousness. 
You don’t know or see that. 
But I know it and see it. 
Since this self is annihilated and destroyed when the body breaks up, and doesn’t exist after death, that’s how this self becomes rightly annihilated.’ 
That is how some assert the annihilation of an existing being. 
But someone else says to them: 
‘*That* self of which you speak does exist, I don’t deny it. 
But that’s not how *this* self becomes rightly annihilated. 
There is another self that has gone totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness. Aware that “there is nothing at all”, it’s been reborn in the dimension of nothingness. 
You don’t know or see that. 
But I know it and see it. 
Since this self is annihilated and destroyed when the body breaks up, and doesn’t exist after death, that’s how this self becomes rightly annihilated.’ 
That is how some assert the annihilation of an existing being. 
But someone else says to them: 
‘*That* self of which you speak does exist, I don’t deny it. 
But that’s not how *this* self becomes rightly annihilated. 
There is another self that has gone totally beyond the dimension of nothingness. Aware that “this is peaceful, this is sublime”, it’s been reborn in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. 
You don’t know or see that. 
But I know it and see it. 
Since this self is annihilated and destroyed when the body breaks up, and doesn’t exist after death, that’s how this self becomes rightly annihilated.’ 
That is how some assert the annihilation of an existing being. 
These are the seven grounds on which those ascetics and brahmins assert the annihilation, eradication, and obliteration of an existing being. 
Any ascetics and brahmins who assert the annihilation, eradication, and obliteration of an existing being do so on one or other of these seven grounds. Outside of this there is none. 
The Realized One understands this … 
And those who genuinely praise the Realized One would rightly speak of these things. 
3.2.5. Extinguishment in the Present Life 
There are some ascetics and brahmins who speak of extinguishment in the present life. They assert the ultimate extinguishment of an existing being in the present life on five grounds. 
And what are the five grounds on which they rely? 
There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view: 
‘When this self amuses itself, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation, that’s how this self attains ultimate extinguishment in the present life.’ 
That is how some assert the extinguishment of an existing being in the present life. 
But someone else says to them: 
‘*That* self of which you speak does exist, I don’t deny it. 
But that’s not how *this* self attains ultimate extinguishment in the present life. 
Why is that? 
Because sensual pleasures are impermanent, suffering, and perishable. Their decay and perishing give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. 
Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, this self enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. That’s how this self attains ultimate extinguishment in the present life.’ 
That is how some assert the extinguishment of an existing being in the present life. 
But someone else says to them: 
‘*That* self of which you speak does exist, I don’t deny it. 
But that’s not how *this* self attains ultimate extinguishment in the present life. 
Why is that? 
Because the placing of the mind and the keeping it connected there are coarse. 
But when the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, this self enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. That’s how this self attains ultimate extinguishment in the present life.’ 
That is how some assert the extinguishment of an existing being in the present life. 
But someone else says to them: 
‘*That* self of which you speak does exist, I don’t deny it. 
But that’s not how *this* self attains ultimate extinguishment in the present life. 
Why is that? 
Because the rapture and emotional excitement there are coarse. 
But with the fading away of rapture, this self enters and remains in the third absorption, where it meditates with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, “Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss”. That’s how this self attains ultimate extinguishment in the present life.’ 
That is how some assert the extinguishment of an existing being in the present life. 
But someone else says to them: 
‘*That* self of which you speak does exist, I don’t deny it. 
But that’s not how *this* self attains ultimate extinguishment in the present life. 
Why is that? 
Because the bliss and enjoyment there are coarse. 
But giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, this self enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. That’s how this self attains ultimate extinguishment in the present life.’ 
That is how some assert the extinguishment of an existing being in the present life. 
These are the five grounds on which those ascetics and brahmins assert the ultimate extinguishment of an existing being in the present life. 
Any ascetics and brahmins who assert the ultimate extinguishment of an existing being in the present life do so on one or other of these five grounds. Outside of this there is none. 
The Realized One understands this … 
And those who genuinely praise the Realized One would rightly speak of these things. 
These are the forty-four grounds on which those ascetics and brahmins who theorize about the future assert various hypotheses concerning the future. 
Any ascetics and brahmins who theorize about the future do so on one or other of these forty-four grounds. Outside of this there is none. 
The Realized One understands this … 
And those who genuinely praise the Realized One would rightly speak of these things. 
These are the sixty-two grounds on which those ascetics and brahmins who theorize about the past and the future assert various hypotheses concerning the past and the future. 
Any ascetics and brahmins who theorize about the past or the future do so on one or other of these sixty-two grounds. Outside of this there is none. 
The Realized One understands this: 
‘If you hold on to and attach to these grounds for views it leads to such and such a destiny in the next life.’ 
He understands this, and what goes beyond this. Yet since he does not misapprehend that understanding, he has realized extinguishment within himself. 
Having truly understood the origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape from feelings, the Realized One is freed through not grasping. 
These are the principles—deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of reason, subtle, comprehensible to the astute—which the Realized One makes known after realizing them with his own insight. And those who genuinely praise the Realized One would rightly speak of these things. 
4. The Grounds For Assertions About the Self and the Cosmos 
4.1. Anxiety and Evasiveness 
Now, these things are only the feeling of those who do not know or see, the agitation and evasiveness of those under the sway of craving. Namely, when those ascetics and brahmins assert that the self and the cosmos are eternal on four grounds … 
partially eternal on four grounds … 
finite or infinite on four grounds … 
or they resort to equivocation on four grounds … 
or they assert that the self and the cosmos arose by chance on two grounds … 
they theorize about the past on these eighteen grounds … 
or they assert that the self lives on after death in a percipient form on sixteen grounds … 
or that the self lives on after death in a non-percipient form on eight grounds … 
or that the self lives on after death in a neither percipient nor non-percipient form on eight grounds … 
or they assert the annihilation of an existing being on seven grounds … 
or they assert the ultimate extinguishment of an existing being in the present life on five grounds … 
they theorize about the future on these forty-four grounds … 
When those ascetics and brahmins theorize about the past and the future on these sixty-two grounds, these things are only the feeling of those who do not know or see, the agitation and evasiveness of those under the sway of craving. 
4.2. Conditioned by Contact 
Now, these things are conditioned by contact. Namely, when those ascetics and brahmins assert that the self and the cosmos are eternal on four grounds … 
partially eternal on four grounds … 
finite or infinite on four grounds … 
or they resort to equivocation on four grounds … 
or they assert that the self and the cosmos arose by chance on two grounds … 
they theorize about the past on these eighteen grounds … 
or they assert that the self lives on after death in a percipient form on sixteen grounds … 
or that the self lives on after death in a non-percipient form on eight grounds … 
or that the self lives on after death in a neither percipient nor non-percipient form on eight grounds … 
or they assert the annihilation of an existing being on seven grounds … 
or they assert the ultimate extinguishment of an existing being in the present life on five grounds … 
they theorize about the future on these forty-four grounds … 
When those ascetics and brahmins theorize about the past and the future on these sixty-two grounds, that too is conditioned by contact. 
4.3. Not Possible

Now, when those ascetics and brahmins theorize about the past and the future on these sixty-two grounds, it is not possible that they should experience these things without contact. 
4.4. Dependent Origination

Now, when those ascetics and brahmins theorize about the past and the future on these sixty-two grounds, all of them experience this by repeated contact through the six fields of contact. Their feeling is a condition for craving. Craving is a condition for grasping. Grasping is a condition for continued existence. Continued existence is a condition for rebirth. Rebirth is a condition for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come to be. 
5. The End of the Round 
When a mendicant truly understands the six fields of contacts’ origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape, they understand what lies beyond all these things. 
All of these ascetics and brahmins who theorize about the past or the future are trapped in the net of these sixty-two grounds, so that wherever they emerge they are caught and trapped in this very net. 
Suppose a deft fisherman or his apprentice were to cast a fine-meshed net over a small pond. They’d think: ‘Any sizable creatures in this pond will be trapped in the net. Wherever they emerge they are caught and trapped in this very net.’ 
In the same way, all of these ascetics and brahmins who theorize about the past or the future are trapped in the net of these sixty-two grounds, so that wherever they emerge they are caught and trapped in this very net. 
The Realized One’s body remains, but his attachment to rebirth has been cut off. 
As long as his body remains he will be seen by gods and humans. 
But when his body breaks up, after life has ended, gods and humans will see him no more. 
When the stalk of a bunch of mangoes is cut, all the mangoes attached to the stalk will follow along. 
In the same way, the Realized One’s body remains, but his attachment to rebirth has been cut off. 
As long as his body remains he will be seen by gods and humans. 
But when his body breaks up, after life has ended, gods and humans will see him no more.” 
When he had spoken, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha, 
“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing! What is the name of this exposition of the teaching?” 
“Well, then, Ānanda, you may remember this exposition of the teaching as ‘The Net of Meaning’, or else ‘The Net of the Teaching’, or else ‘The Prime Net’, or else ‘The Net of Views’, or else ‘The Supreme Victory in Battle’.” 
That is what the Buddha said. 
Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said. 
And while this discourse was being spoken, the galaxy shook.
