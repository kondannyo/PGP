Long Discourses 26 
The Wheel-Turning Monarch 
1. Taking Refuge in Oneself 
So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Magadhans at Mātulā. 
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, 
“Mendicants!” 
“Venerable sir,” they replied. 
The Buddha said this: 
“Mendicants, be your own island, your own refuge, with no other refuge. Let the teaching be your island and your refuge, with no other refuge. 
And how does a mendicant do this? 
They meditate observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. 
They meditate observing an aspect of feelings … 
mind … 
principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. 
That’s how a mendicant is their own island, their own refuge, with no other refuge. That’s how they let the teaching be their island and their refuge, with no other refuge. 
You should roam inside your own territory, the domain of your fathers. 
If you roam inside your own territory, the domain of your fathers, Māra won’t catch you or get hold of you. 
# NOTE: This line feels awkward, and I suspect that both here and in its recurrence at the end it is clumsily inserted. It’s not clear what “idam” refers to. Both RD and MW translate “evamidam” as if it were eva’m’idam, but this is unlikely. Evamidam is used to indicate entailment, eg MN 73. Comm: “Evamidaṃ puññaṃ pavaḍḍhatīti evaṃ idaṃ lokiyalokuttaraṃ puññaphalaṃ vaḍḍhati, puññaphalanti ca uparūpari puññampi puññavipākopi veditabbo.”
It is due to undertaking skillful qualities that this merit grows. 
2. King Daḷhanemi 
Once upon a time, mendicants, there was a king named Daḷhanemi who was a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. His dominion extended to all four sides, he achieved stability in the country, and he possessed the seven treasures. 
He had the following seven treasures: 
the wheel, the elephant, the horse, the jewel, the woman, the treasurer, and the counselor as the seventh treasure. 
He had over a thousand sons who were valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of his enemies. 
After conquering this land girt by sea, he reigned by principle, without rod or sword. 
Then, after many years, many hundred years, many thousand years had passed, King Daḷhanemi addressed one of his men, 
# NOTE: osakkati: like a woman shrinking away from a man’s advances (DN 12), or a ram drawing back getting ready to charge (Ja 324).
‘My good man, when you see that the heavenly wheel-treasure has receded back from its place, please tell me.’ 
‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ replied that man. 
After many thousand years had passed, that man saw that the heavenly wheel-treasure had receded back from its place. So he went to King Daḷhanemi and said, 
‘Please sire, you should know that your heavenly wheel-treasure has receded back from its place.’ 
So the king summoned the crown prince and said, 
‘Dear prince, my heavenly wheel-treasure has receded back from its place. 
I’ve heard that 
when this happens to a wheel-turning monarch, he does not have long to live. 
I have enjoyed human pleasures. Now it is time for me to seek heavenly pleasures. 
Come, dear prince, rule this land surrounded by ocean! 
I shall shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.’ 
And so, after carefully instructing the crown prince in kingship, King Daḷhanemi shaved off his hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness. 
Seven days later the heavenly wheel-treasure vanished. 
Then a certain man approached the newly anointed aristocrat king and said, 
‘Please sire, you should know that the heavenly wheel-treasure has vanished.’ 
At that the king was unhappy and experienced unhappiness. 
He went to the royal sage and said, 
‘Please sire, you should know that the heavenly wheel-treasure has vanished.’ 
When he said this, the royal sage said to him, 
‘Don’t be unhappy at the vanishing of the wheel-treasure. My dear, the wheel-treasure is not inherited from your father. 
# NOTE: Since this is the only place where ariya qualifies cakkavatti, I assume it refers to the duties, similar to ariyavinaya. Also see the title below, Cakkavattiariyavatta
Come now, my dear, implement the noble duties of a wheel-turning monarch. 
If you do so, it’s possible that—on a fifteenth day sabbath, having bathed your head and gone upstairs in the stilt longhouse to observe the sabbath—the heavenly wheel-treasure will appear to you, with a thousand spokes, with rim and hub, complete in every detail.’ 
2.1. The Noble Duties of a Wheel-Turning Monarch 
‘But sire, what are the noble duties of a wheel-turning monarch?’ 
# NOTE: saṃvidahassu is second middle imperative
‘Well then, my dear, relying only on principle—honoring, respecting, and venerating principle, having principle as your flag, banner, and authority—provide just protection and security for your court, troops, aristocrats, vassals, brahmins and householders, people of town and country, ascetics and brahmins, beasts and birds. 
# NOTE: pavattittha is aorist middle. Curiously, (a)dhammakāra doesn’t seem to occur elswehere in the EBTs. It does occur in Ja 513 and Ja 498, both times in the context of just rule: Adhammakāro tava māhu raṭṭhe
Do not let injustice prevail in the realm. 
# NOTE: While anuppadeti is given in the dicts in the sense of “give, hand over”, in the nikayas it seems to be restricted to “pay” in the sense of a just reward for work, or return on a loan. While I wouldn’t want to over-interpret it, it is an interesting choice here, which suggests more “pay them a fair wage “than” support them with charity”.
Pay money to the penniless in the realm. 
# NOTE: Where this idiom occurs elsewhere, it is inevitably with paripucchati paripañhati. PTS here omits the second verb. Comm is silent. Generally the suttas are very precise about the sequence of learning: first you ask, then you listen, then you learn. Most likely this is a mistake here.
And there are ascetics and brahmins in the realm who avoid intoxication and negligence, are settled in patience and gentleness, and who tame, calm, and extinguish themselves. From time to time you should go up to them and ask: 
“Sirs, what is skillful? What is unskillful? What is blameworthy? What is blameless? What should be cultivated? What should not be cultivated? Doing what leads to my lasting harm and suffering? Doing what leads to my lasting welfare and happiness?” 
Having heard them, you should reject what is unskillful and undertake and follow what is skillful. 
These are the noble duties of a wheel-turning monarch.’ 
2.2. The Wheel-Treasure Appears 
‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ replied the new king to the royal sage. And he implemented the noble duties of a wheel-turning monarch. 
While he was implementing them, on a fifteenth day sabbath, he had bathed his head and gone upstairs in the stilt longhouse to observe the sabbath. 
And the heavenly wheel-treasure appeared to him, with a thousand spokes, with rim and hub, complete in every detail. 
Seeing this, the king thought, 
‘I have heard that when the heavenly wheel-treasure appears to a king in this way, he becomes a wheel-turning monarch. 
Am I then a wheel-turning monarch?’ 
Then the anointed king, rising from his seat and arranging his robe over one shoulder, took a ceremonial vase in his left hand and besprinkled the wheel-treasure with his right hand, saying, 
‘Roll forth, O wheel-treasure! Triumph, O wheel-treasure!’ 
Then the wheel-treasure rolled towards the east. And the king followed it together with his army of four divisions. In whatever place the wheel-treasure stood still, there the king came to stay together with his army. 
And any opposing rulers of the eastern quarter came to the wheel-turning monarch and said, 
‘Come, great king! Welcome, great king! We are yours, great king, instruct us.’ 
The wheel-turning monarch said, 
‘Do not kill living creatures. Do not steal. Do not commit sexual misconduct. Do not lie. Do not drink alcohol. Maintain the current level of taxation.’ 
And so the opposing rulers of the eastern quarter became his vassals. 
Then the wheel-treasure, having plunged into the eastern ocean and emerged again, rolled towards the south. … 
Having plunged into the southern ocean and emerged again, it rolled towards the west. …

Having plunged into the western ocean and emerged again, it rolled towards the north, followed by the king together with his army of four divisions. 
In whatever place the wheel-treasure stood still, there the king came to stay together with his army. 
And any opposing rulers of the northern quarter came to the wheel-turning monarch and said, 
‘Come, great king! Welcome, great king! We are yours, great king, instruct us.’ 
The wheel-turning monarch said, 
‘Do not kill living creatures. Do not steal. Do not commit sexual misconduct. Do not lie. Do not drink alcohol. Maintain the current level of taxation.’ 
And so the rulers of the northern quarter became his vassals. 
# NOTE: https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/does-a-akara-a-mean-judgment-hall/3399
And then the wheel-treasure, having triumphed over this land surrounded by ocean, returned to the royal capital. There it stood still by the gate to the royal compound at the High Court as if fixed to an axle, illuminating the royal compound. 
3. On Subsequent Wheel-Turning Monarchs 
And for a second time, 
and a third, 
a fourth, 
a fifth, 
a sixth, 
and a seventh time, a wheel-turning monarch was established in exactly the same way. And after many years the seventh wheel-turning monarch went forth, handing the realm over to the crown prince.

Seven days later the heavenly wheel-treasure vanished. 
Then a certain man approached the newly anointed aristocrat king and said, 
‘Please sire, you should know that the heavenly wheel-treasure has vanished.’ 
At that the king was unhappy and experienced unhappiness. 
But he didn’t go to the royal sage and ask about the noble duties of a wheel-turning monarch. 
He just governed the country according to his own ideas. 
# NOTE: I don’t know what pabbanti means, but comm sensibly has “na pabbantīti na vaḍḍhanti”. Note janapada in plural; extrapolating from the contemporary situation, it seems that the realm of the cakkavatti was comprised of several smaller nations. Both RD and MW mistranslate as “people” here.
So governed, the nations did not prosper like before, as they had when former kings implemented the noble duties of a wheel-turning monarch. 
# NOTE: For anīkaṭṭhā, RD and MW both have “guards”. However comm says “Anīkaṭṭhāti hatthiācariyādayo”, which for some reason CPD thinks is worthy of an exclamation point. But surely this is reasonable: those in charge of the elephants and so on would have been important officials in the army. I think it is standing officers in the army, rather than royal guards as such. For mantassājīvino, RD and MW think it means chanters of mantras, but comm has “Mantassājīvinoti mantā vuccati paññā, taṃ nissayaṃ katvā ye jīvanti paṇḍitā mahāmattā, tesaṃ etaṃ nāmaṃ.”
Then the ministers and counselors, the treasury officials, military officers, guardsmen, and advisers gathered and said to the king, 
‘Sire, when governed according to your own ideas, the nations do not prosper like before, as they did when former kings implemented the noble duties of a wheel-turning monarch. 
In your realm are found ministers and counselors, treasury officials, military officers, guardsmen, and advisers—both ourselves and others—who remember the noble duties of a wheel-turning monarch. 
Please, Your Majesty, ask us about the noble duties of a wheel-turning monarch. 
We will answer you.’ 
4. On the Period of Decline 
So the anointed king asked the assembled ministers and counselors, treasury officials, military officers, guardsmen, and advisers about the noble duties of a wheel-turning monarch. 
And they answered him. 
But after listening to them, he didn’t provide just protection and security. Nor did he pay money to the penniless in the realm. 
And so poverty grew widespread. 
When poverty was widespread, a certain person stole from others, with the intention to commit theft. 
They arrested him 
and presented him to the king, saying, 
‘Your Majesty, this person stole from others with the intention to commit theft.’ 
The king said to that person, 
‘Is it really true, mister, that you stole from others with the intention to commit theft?’ 
‘It’s true, sire.’ 
‘What was the reason?’ 
‘Sire, I can’t survive.’ 
So the king paid some money to that person, saying, 
‘With this money, mister, keep yourself alive, and provide for your mother and father, partners and children. Work for a living, and establish an uplifting religious donation for ascetics and brahmins that’s conducive to heaven, ripens in happiness, and leads to heaven.’ 
‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ replied that man. 
But then another man stole something from others. 
They arrested him 
and presented him to the king, saying, 
‘Your Majesty, this person stole from others.’ 
The king said to that person, 
‘Is it really true, mister, that you stole from others?’ 
‘It’s true, sire.’ 
‘What was the reason?’ 
‘Sire, I can’t survive.’ 
So the king paid some money to that person, saying, 
‘With this money, mister, keep yourself alive, and provide for your mother and father, partners and children. Work for a living, and establish an uplifting religious donation for ascetics and brahmins that’s conducive to heaven, ripens in happiness, and leads to heaven.’ 
‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ replied that man. 
People heard about this: 
‘It seems the king is paying money to anyone who steals from others!’ 
It occurred to them, 
‘Why don’t we steal from others?’ 
So then another man stole something from others. 
They arrested him 
and presented him to the king, saying, 
‘Your Majesty, this person stole from others.’ 
The king said to that person, 
‘Is it really true, mister, that you stole from others?’ 
‘It’s true, sire.’ 
‘What was the reason?’ 
‘Sire, I can’t survive.’ 
Then the king thought, 
‘If I pay money to anyone who steals from others, it will only increase the stealing. 
I’d better make an end of this person, finish him off, and chop off his head.’ 
Then he ordered his men, 
‘Well then, my men, tie this man’s arms tightly behind his back with a strong rope. Shave his head and march him from street to street and square to square to the beating of a harsh drum. Then take him out the south gate and make an end of him, finish him off, and chop off his head.’ 
‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ they replied, and did as he commanded. 
People heard about this: 
‘It seems the king is chopping the head off anyone who steals from others!’ 
It occurred to them, 
‘We’d better have sharp swords made. Then when we steal from others, we’ll make an end of them, finish them off, and chop off their heads.’ 
They had sharp swords made. Then they started to make raids on villages, towns, and cities, and to infest the highways. 
And they chopped the heads off anyone they stole from. 
And so, mendicants, from not paying money to the penniless, poverty became widespread. When poverty was widespread, theft became widespread. When theft was widespread, swords became widespread. When swords were widespread, killing living creatures became widespread. And for the sentient beings among whom killing was widespread, their lifespan and beauty declined. 
Those people lived for 80,000 years, but their children lived for 40,000 years. 
Among the people who lived for 40,000 years, a certain person stole something from others. 
They arrested him 
and presented him to the king, saying, 
‘Your Majesty, this person stole from others.’ 
The king said to that person, 
‘Is it really true, mister, that you stole from others?’ 
‘No, sire,’ he said, deliberately lying. 
And so, mendicants, from not paying money to the penniless, poverty, theft, swords, and killing became widespread. When killing was widespread, lying became widespread. And for the sentient beings among whom lying was widespread, their lifespan and beauty declined. 
Those people who lived for 40,000 years had children who lived for 20,000 years. 
Among the people who lived for 20,000 years, a certain person stole something from others. 
Someone else reported this to the king, 
‘Your Majesty, such-and-such person stole from others,’ he said, going behind his back. 
And so, mendicants, from not paying money to the penniless, poverty, theft, swords, killing, and lying became widespread. When lying was widespread, backbiting became widespread. And for the sentient beings among whom backbiting was widespread, their lifespan and beauty declined. 
Those people who lived for 20,000 years had children who lived for 10,000 years. 
Among the people who lived for 10,000 years, some were more beautiful than others. 
And the ugly beings, coveting the beautiful ones, committed adultery with others’ wives. 
And so, mendicants, from not paying money to the penniless, poverty, theft, swords, killing, lying, and backbiting became widespread. When backbiting was widespread, sexual misconduct became widespread. And for the sentient beings among whom sexual misconduct was widespread, their lifespan and beauty declined. 
Those people who lived for 10,000 years had children who lived for 5,000 years. 
Among the people who lived for 5,000 years, two things became widespread: 
harsh speech and talking nonsense. 
For the sentient beings among whom these two things were widespread, their lifespan and beauty declined. 
Those people who lived for 5,000 years had some children who lived for 2,500 years, while others lived for 2,000 years. 
Among the people who lived for 2,500 years, desire and ill will became widespread. 
For the sentient beings among whom desire and ill will were widespread, their lifespan and beauty declined. 
Those people who lived for 2,500 years had children who lived for 1,000 years. 
Among the people who lived for 1,000 years, wrong view became widespread. 
For the sentient beings among whom wrong view was widespread, their lifespan and beauty declined. 
Those people who lived for 1,000 years had children who lived for five hundred years. 
Among the people who lived for five hundred years, three things became widespread: 
illicit desire, immoral greed, and wrong thoughts. 
For the sentient beings among whom these three things were widespread, their lifespan and beauty declined. 
Those people who lived for five hundred years had some children who lived for two hundred and fifty years, while others lived for two hundred years. 
Among the people who lived for two hundred and fifty years, three things became widespread: 
lack of due respect for mother and father, ascetics and brahmins, and failure to honor the elders in the family. 
And so, mendicants, from not paying money to the penniless, all these things became widespread—poverty, 
theft, 
swords, 
killing, 
lying, 
backbiting, 
sexual misconduct, 
harsh speech and talking nonsense, 
desire and ill will, 
wrong view, 
illicit desire, immoral greed, and wrong thoughts, 
and lack of due respect for mother and father, ascetics and brahmins, and failure to honor the elders in the family. 
For the sentient beings among whom these things were widespread, their lifespan and beauty declined. 
Those people who lived for two hundred and fifty years had children who lived for a hundred years. 
5. When People Live for Ten Years 
There will come a time, mendicants, when these people will have children who live for ten years. 
Among the people who live for ten years, girls will be marriageable at five. 
The following flavors will disappear: 
ghee, butter, oil, honey, molasses, and salt. 
# NOTE: Horner has “rye” for kudrūsaka, but rye is a European grain. Finger millet is a widespread secondary grain in India, which grows in places rice cannot. While in Sri Lanka I learned that it is grown in the South, where it is too hot and dry for rice. But with the influence of climate change, rice will soon be unviable and finger millet, or kurukkan, will become essential. When I learned of this I was immediately reminded of this passage. I have no idea whether the word kurukkan is related to kudrusaka, but some of the other Indic terms for this grain seem to be, eg. the Pahari term “kodra”, Garhwal “koda”.
The best kind of food will be finger millet, 
just as fine rice with meat is the best kind of food today. 
{}
# NOTE: Comm has “Atibyādippissantīti ativiya dippissanti, ayameva vā pāṭho” so its mainline version must have been Atibyādippissanti or similar. But this leaves unexplained the long ā in the sandhi. At the same time, the sense of dippati is not entirely clear here. RD has “flourish”, MW has “prevail”, but neither of these is really what it means. If anything, its basic meaning of “appear, show” contrasts more directly with antaradhayati. However, note that ādippati occurs, I think, once elsewhere in the canon, in AN 7.66, which by coincidence or not, also concerns a myth of the future. There it refers to an erupting volcano. Given that this explains the long ā, and that the unusual and emphatic form suggests a powerful meaning, I suggest that the sense “explode” (in popularity, etc.) fits here.
The ten ways of doing skillful deeds will totally disappear, and the ten ways of doing unskillful deeds will explode in popularity. 
Those people will not even have the word ‘skillful’, still less anyone who does what is skillful. 
And anyone who disrespects mother and father, ascetics and brahmins, and fails to honor the elders in the family will be venerated and praised, 
just as the opposite is venerated and praised today. 
{}
# NOTE: See AN 2.9.
There’ll be no recognition of the status of mother, aunts, or wives and partners of teachers and respected people. 
# NOTE: For sambheda, see AN 2.9=DN 26, AN 5.103 = AN 10.45, and DN 3. In each case the sense is not “breaking, destroying” as you might expect, but the dissolving of boundaries, resulting in promiscuity or leaking of secrets. Comm. to DN 26 has “Sambhedanti missībhāvaṃ, mariyādabhedaṃ vā.”
The world will become promiscuous, like goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, and dogs and jackals. 
They’ll be full of hostility towards each other, with acute ill will, malevolence, and thoughts of murder. 
Even a mother will feel like this for her child, and the child for its mother, 
father for child, child for father, 
brother for sister, and sister for brother. 
They’ll be just like a deer hunter when he sees a deer—full of hostility, ill will, malevolence, and thoughts of killing. 
{}
{}
{}
{}
Among the people who live for ten years, there will be an interregnum of swords lasting seven days. 
During that time they will see each other as beasts. 
Sharp swords will appear in their hands, 
with which they’ll take each other’s life, crying, ‘It’s a beast! It’s a beast!’ 
But then some of those beings will think, 
‘Let us neither be perpetrators nor victims! Why don’t we hide in thick grass, thick jungle, thick trees, inaccessible riverlands, or rugged mountains and survive on forest roots and fruits?’ 
So that’s what they do. 
# NOTE: According to Cone (gāyati), sabhāgāyissanti is correct and PTS sabhā gāyissanti incorrect. Sabhāgāyissanti = sabhāga + āyissanti = will come together. samassāsissanti = sama + sāsati is absent from some manuscripts and is not commented on; I think it’s dubious.
When those seven days have passed, having emerged from their hiding places and embraced each other, they will come together in one voice and cry, 
# NOTE: Diṭṭhā here probably doesn’t mean “seen, but” hurrah!"The plural for satt-a is puzzling; one var in PTS edition has the second as satta = voc sing, which I take as correct. Otherwise we would expect bhonto sattā, but this disagrees with the verb.
‘How fantastic, dear being, you live! How fantastic, dear being, you live!’ 
6. The Period of Growth 
Then those beings will think, 
‘It’s because we undertook unskillful things that we suffered such an extensive loss of our relatives. 
We’d better do what’s skillful. 
What skillful thing should we do? 
Why don’t we refrain from killing living creatures? Having undertaken this skillful thing we’ll live by it.’ 
So that’s what they do. 
Because of undertaking this skillful thing, their lifespan and beauty will grow. 
Those people who live for ten years will have children who live for twenty years. 
Then those beings will think, 
‘Because of undertaking this skillful thing, our lifespan and beauty are growing. 
Why don’t we do even more skillful things? 
What skillful thing should we do? 
Why don’t we refrain from stealing … 
sexual misconduct … 
lying … 
backbiting … 
harsh speech … 
and talking nonsense. 
Why don’t we give up covetousness … 
ill will … 
wrong view … 
three things: 
illicit desire, immoral greed, and wrong thoughts. 
Why don’t we pay due respect to mother and father, ascetics and brahmins, honoring the elders in our families? Having undertaken this skillful thing we’ll live by it.’ 
So that’s what they do. 
Because of undertaking this skillful thing, their lifespan and beauty will grow. 
Those people who live for twenty years will have children who live for forty years. 
Those people who live for forty years will have children who live for eighty years, 
then a hundred and sixty years, 
three hundred and twenty years, 
six hundred and forty years, 
2,000 years, 
4,000 years, 
8,000 years, 
20,000 years, 
40,000 years, 
and finally 80,000 years. 
Among the people who live for 80,000 years, girls will be marriageable at five hundred. 
7. The Time of King Saṅkha 
Among the people who live for 80,000 years, there will be just three afflictions: greed, starvation, and old age. 
India will be successful and prosperous. The villages, towns, and capital cities will be no more than a chicken’s flight apart. 
And the land will be as crowded as hell, just full of people, like a thicket of rushes or reeds. 
The royal capital will be our Benares, but renamed Ketumati. And it will be successful, prosperous, populous, full of people, with plenty of food. 
There will be 84,000 cities in India, with the royal capital of Ketumati foremost. 
And in the royal capital of Ketumati a king named Saṅkha will arise, a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. His dominion will extend to all four sides, he will achieve stability in the country, and possess the seven treasures. 
He will have the following seven treasures: 
the wheel, the elephant, the horse, the jewel, the woman, the treasurer, and the counselor as the seventh treasure. 
He will have over a thousand sons who are valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of his enemies. 
After conquering this land girt by sea, he will reign by principle, without rod or sword. 
8. The Arising of the Buddha Metteyya 
And the Blessed One named Metteyya will arise in the world—perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed—
just as I have arisen today. 
He will realize with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and make it known to others, just as I do today. 
He will teach the Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he will reveal a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure, 
just as I do today. 
# NOTE: Interesting choice of verb here: pariharati is not lead or command, but nurture, like a mother the child in her womb.
He will look after a Saṅgha of many thousand mendicants, just as I look after a Saṅgha of many hundreds today. 
# NOTE: This oddity is found in Bhaddaji’s verses at Thag 2.22 and the full story at Ja 264. While the Comm. stories, followed by RD and MW, say this is a palace, the verses there clearly depict a sacrificial post, yūpa. Probably the original meaning of this reference was lost early on, and the story filled in.
Then King Saṅkha will have the sacrificial post that had been built by King Mahāpanāda raised up. 
After staying there, he will give it away to ascetics and brahmins, paupers, vagrants, travelers, and beggars. Then, having shaved off his hair and beard and dressed in ocher robes, he will go forth from the lay life to homelessness in the Buddha Metteyya’s presence. 
Soon after going forth, living withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, he will realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He will live having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. 
Mendicants, be your own island, your own refuge, with no other refuge. Let the teaching be your island and your refuge, with no other refuge. 
And how does a mendicant do this? 
It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. 
They meditate observing an aspect of feelings … 
mind … 
principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. 
That’s how a mendicant is their own island, their own refuge, with no other refuge. That’s how they let the teaching be their island and their refuge, with no other refuge. 
9. On Long Life and Beauty for Mendicants 
Mendicants, you should roam inside your own territory, the domain of your fathers. 
Doing so, you will grow in life span, beauty, happiness, wealth, and power. 
And what is long life for a mendicant? 
It’s when a mendicant develops the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to enthusiasm, and active effort. 
They develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to energy, and active effort. 
They develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to mental development, and active effort. 
They develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to inquiry, and active effort. 
Having developed and cultivated these four bases of psychic power they may, if they wish, live on for the eon or what’s left of the eon. 
This is long life for a mendicant. 
And what is beauty for a mendicant? 
It’s when a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. 
This is beauty for a mendicant. 
And what is happiness for a mendicant? 
It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. 
As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption … 
third absorption … 
fourth absorption. 
This is happiness for a mendicant. 
And what is wealth for a mendicant? 
It’s when a monk meditates spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. 
They meditate spreading a heart full of compassion … 
rejoicing … 
equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. 
This is wealth for a mendicant. 
And what is power for a mendicant? 
It’s when a mendicant realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. 
This is power for a mendicant. 
Mendicants, I do not see a single power so hard to defeat as the power of Māra. 
It is due to undertaking skillful qualities that this merit grows.” 
That is what the Buddha said. 
Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.
