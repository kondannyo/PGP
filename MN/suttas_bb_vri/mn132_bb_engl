132. Ānandabhaddekaratta Sutta
Ānanda and A Single Excellent Night

1. Thus have I heard.
On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.

2. Now on that occasion the venerable Ānanda was instructing, urging, rousing, and gladdening the bhikkhus with talk on the Dhamma in the assembly hall.
He was reciting the summary and exposition of “One Who Has Had a Single Excellent Night.”

Then, in the evening, the Blessed One rose from meditation and went to the assembly hall.
He sat down on a seat made ready and asked the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus, who has been instructing, urging, rousing, and gladdening the bhikkhus with talk on the Dhamma in the assembly hall?
Who has been reciting the summary and exposition of ‘One Who Has Had a Single Excellent Night’?”

“It was the venerable Ānanda, venerable sir.”

Then the Blessed One asked the venerable Ānanda: “Ānanda, how were you instructing, urging, rousing, and gladdening the bhikkhus with talk on the Dhamma, and reciting the summary and exposition of ‘One Who Has Had a Single Excellent Night’?”

3-10.
“I was doing so thus, venerable sir:‘Let not a person revive the past…

(Repeat the whole of the last sutta, §§3-10 up to:)

Who has had a single excellent night.’

11. “I was instructing, urging, rousing, and gladdening the bhikkhus with talk on the Dhamma thus, and reciting the summary and exposition of ‘One Who Has Had a Single Excellent Night’ thus.”

“Good, good, Ānanda!
It is good that you were instructing, urging, rousing, and gladdening the bhikkhus with talk on the Dhamma thus, and reciting the summary and exposition of ‘One Who Has Had a Single Excellent Night’ thus:12-19.
“Let not a person revive the past…

(Repeat the whole of the last sutta, §§3-10 up to:)

Who has had a single excellent night.”

That is what the Blessed One said.
The venerable Ānanda was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One’s words.
