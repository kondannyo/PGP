The Root of All Things 

So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Ukkaṭṭhā, in the Subhaga Forest at the root of a magnificent <i>sal</i> tree. 
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, 
“Mendicants!” 
“Venerable sir,” they replied. 
The Buddha said this: 

“Mendicants, I will teach you the explanation of the root of all things. 
Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 
“Yes, sir,” they replied. 
The Buddha said this: 

“Take an uneducated ordinary person who has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen good persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the good persons.

But he doesn’t identify with earth, he doesn’t identify regarding earth, he doesn’t identify as earth, he doesn’t identify that ‘earth is mine’, he doesn’t take pleasure in earth. 
Why is that? 
Because he has understood that relishing is the root of suffering, 
and that rebirth comes from continued existence; whoever has come to be gets old and dies. 
That’s why the Realized One—with the ending, fading away, cessation, giving up, and letting go of all cravings—has awakened to the supreme perfect Awakening, I say.
