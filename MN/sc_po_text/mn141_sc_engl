Middle Discourses 141 
The Analysis of the Truths 

So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Benares, in the deer park at Isipatana. 
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, 
“Mendicants!” 
“Venerable sir,” they replied. 
The Buddha said this: 

“Near Benares, in the deer park at Isipatana, the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha rolled forth the supreme Wheel of Dhamma. And that wheel cannot be rolled back by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world. 
It is the teaching, advocating, establishing, clarifying, analyzing, and revealing of the four noble truths. 

What four? 

The noble truths of suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering. 
Near Benares, in the deer park at Isipatana, the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha rolled forth the supreme Wheel of Dhamma. And that wheel cannot be rolled back by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world. 
It is the teaching, advocating, establishing, clarifying, analyzing, and revealing of the four noble truths. 

Mendicants, you should cultivate friendship with Sāriputta and Moggallāna. 
You should associate with Sāriputta and Moggallāna. 
They’re astute, and they support their spiritual companions. 
Sāriputta is just like the mother who gives birth, 
while Moggallāna is like the one who raises the child. 
Sāriputta guides people to the fruit of stream-entry, Moggallāna to the highest goal. 
Sāriputta is able to teach, assert, establish, clarify, analyze, and reveal the four noble truths.” 

That is what the Buddha said. 
When he had spoken, the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling. 

Then soon after the Buddha left, Venerable Sāriputta said to the mendicants, 
“Reverends, mendicants!” 
“Reverend,” they replied. 
Sāriputta said this: 

“Near Benares, in the deer park at Isipatana, the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha rolled forth the supreme Wheel of Dhamma. And that wheel cannot be rolled back by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world. 
It is the teaching, advocating, establishing, clarifying, analyzing, and revealing of the four noble truths.

‘Oh, if only we were not liable to be reborn! If only rebirth would not come to us!’ 
But you can’t get that by wishing. 
This is: ‘not getting what you wish for is suffering.’ 
In sentient beings who are liable to grow old … 
fall ill … 
die … 
experience sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress, such a wish arises: 
‘Oh, if only we were not liable to experience sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress! If only sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress would not come to us!’ 
But you can’t get that by wishing. 
This is: ‘not getting what you wish for is suffering.’ 

And what is ‘in brief, the five grasping aggregates are suffering’? 
They are the grasping aggregates that consist of form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. 
This is called ‘in brief, the five grasping aggregates are suffering.’ 
This is called the noble truth of suffering. 

And what is the noble truth of the origin of suffering? 
It’s the craving that leads to future rebirth, mixed up with relishing and greed, looking for enjoyment in various different realms. That is, 
craving for sensual pleasures, craving to continue existence, and craving to end existence. 
This is called the noble truth of the origin of suffering. 

And what is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering? 
It’s the fading away and cessation of that very same craving with nothing left over; giving it away, letting it go, releasing it, and not adhering to it. 
This is called the noble truth of the cessation of suffering. 

And what is the noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering?

They meditate observing an aspect of feelings … 
mind … 
principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. 
This is called right mindfulness. 

And what is right immersion? 
It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. 
As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. 
And with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ 
Giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. 
This is called right immersion. 
This is called the noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering. 

Near Benares, in the deer park at Isipatana, the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha rolled forth the supreme Wheel of Dhamma. And that wheel cannot be rolled back by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world. 
It is the teaching, advocating, establishing, clarifying, analyzing, and revealing of the four noble truths.” 
That’s what Venerable Sāriputta said. 
Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what Sāriputta said.
