Middle Discourses 78 
With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamuṇḍika 

So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
# NOTE: Comm has “row” for cīra, which seems like a stretch. I can’t find it attested elsewhere in this sense. Skt dict acknowledges the sense row, line, but only in late sources, and I don’t know if it is relevant. BB renders it as “plantation”, evidently referring to the rows of trees in a plantation, though from the commentary’s description it sounds more like a decorative row or hedge. Normally it refers to strips of bark or cloth. At MN 12 we have the simile of a tindukakhanu (ebony trunk) flaking off bark (papatika). And at DN 24 we have the tindukakhāṇu-paribbājakārāmo. I suspect the usual meaning of cīra should apply, i.e. “park littered with strips of tinduka bark”, or perhaps even “the single hall, lined with strips of tinduka bark”. I am at a loss to explain the long ā in sandhi. In DN 24, perhaps also we might read “monastery built from tinduka stumps”. But tinduka is not usually used as a building material, nor is an arama a building. Regarding the numbers, the variants are 300 and 500, I have chosen the less common number.
Now at that time the wanderer Uggāhamāna Samaṇamuṇḍikāputta was residing together with around three hundred wanderers in Mallikā’s single-halled monastery for group debates, set among the flaking pale-moon ebony trees. 

Then the master builder Pañcakaṅga left Sāvatthī in the middle of the day to see the Buddha. 
It occurred to him, 
“It’s the wrong time to see the Buddha, 
as he’s in retreat. 
And it’s the wrong time to see the esteemed mendicants, 
as they’re in retreat. 
Why don’t I go to Mallikā’s monastery to visit the wanderer Uggāhamāna?” 
So that’s what he did. 

Now at that time, Uggāhamāna was sitting together with a large assembly of wanderers making an uproar, a dreadful racket. They engaged in all kinds of unworthy talk, such as 
talk about kings, bandits, and ministers; talk about armies, threats, and wars; talk about food, drink, clothes, and beds; talk about garlands and fragrances; talk about family, vehicles, villages, towns, cities, and countries; talk about women and heroes; street talk and well talk; talk about the departed; motley talk; tales of land and sea; and talk about being reborn in this or that state of existence. 
Uggāhamāna saw Pañcakaṅga coming off in the distance, 
and hushed his own assembly, 
“Be quiet, good sirs, don’t make a sound. 
Here comes Pañcakaṅga, a disciple of the ascetic Gotama. 
He is included among the white-clothed lay disciples of the ascetic Gotama, who is residing in Sāvatthī. 
Such venerables like the quiet, are educated to be quiet, and praise the quiet. 
Hopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet he’ll see fit to approach.” 
Then those wanderers fell silent. 

Then Pañcakaṅga approached Uggāhamāna, and exchanged greetings with him. 
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. Uggāhamāna said to him: 

“Householder, when an individual has four qualities I describe them as an invincible ascetic—accomplished in the skillful, excelling in the skillful, attained to the highest attainment. 
What four? 
It’s when they do no bad deeds with their body; speak no bad words; think no bad thoughts; and don’t earn a living by bad livelihood. 
When an individual has these four qualities I describe them as an invincible ascetic.” 

Then Pañcakaṅga neither approved nor dismissed that mendicant’s statement. 
He got up from his seat, thinking, 
“I will learn the meaning of this statement from the Buddha himself.” 

Then he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, 
and informed the Buddha of all that had been discussed. 

When he had spoken, the Buddha said to him, 
“Master builder, if what Uggāhamāna says is true, a little baby boy is an invincible ascetic—accomplished in the skillful, excelling in the skillful, attained to the highest attainment. 
For a little baby doesn’t even have a concept of ‘a body’, so how could they possibly do a bad deed with their body, apart from just wriggling? 
And a little baby doesn’t even have a concept of ‘speech’, so how could they possibly speak bad words, apart from just crying? 
And a little baby doesn’t even have a concept of ‘thought’, so how could they possibly think bad thoughts, apart from just whimpering? 
And a little baby doesn’t even have a concept of ‘livelihood’, so how could they possibly earn a living by bad livelihood, apart from their mother’s breast? 
If what Uggāhamāna says is true, a little baby boy is an invincible ascetic—accomplished in the skillful, excelling in the skillful, attained to the highest attainment. 
When an individual has four qualities I describe them, not as an invincible ascetic—accomplished in the skillful, excelling in the skillful, attained to the highest attainment—but as having achieved the same level as a little baby. 
What four? 
It’s when they do no bad deeds with their body; speak no bad words; think no bad thoughts; and don’t earn a living by bad livelihood. 
When an individual has these four qualities I describe them, not as an invincible ascetic, but as having achieved the same level as a little baby. 

When an individual has ten qualities, master builder, I describe them as an invincible ascetic—accomplished in the skillful, excelling in the skillful, attained to the highest attainment. 
But certain things must first be understood, I say. ‘These are unskillful behaviors.’ 
 
‘Unskillful behaviors stem from this.’ 
 
‘Here unskillful behaviors cease without anything left over.’ 
 
‘Someone practicing like this is practicing for the cessation of unskillful behaviors.’

Master builder, when an individual has what ten qualities do I describe them as an invincible ascetic—accomplished in the skillful, excelling in the skillful, attained to the highest attainment?

Satisfied, Pañcakaṅga the master builder was happy with what the Buddha said.
