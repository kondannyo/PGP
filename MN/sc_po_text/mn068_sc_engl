Middle Discourses 68
At Naḷakapāna

So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kosalans near Naḷakapāna in the Parrot Tree grove.

Now at that time several very well-known gentlemen had gone forth from the lay life to homelessness out of faith in the Buddha—
# NOTE: The texts vary in the names of the monks here. See Analayo’s note 165, p. 371 of Comparative Study of MN. Apparently only the PTS edition has Nandiya, so that’s probably a mistake.
The venerables Anuruddha, Bhaddiya, Kimbila, Bhagu, Koṇḍañña, Revata, Ānanda, and other very well-known gentlemen.

Now at that time the Buddha was sitting in the open, surrounded by the mendicant Saṅgha.
Then the Buddha spoke to the mendicants about those gentlemen:
“Mendicants, those gentlemen who have gone forth from the lay life to homelessness out of faith in me—I trust they’re satisfied with the spiritual life?”
When this was said, the mendicants kept silent.
For a second and a third time the Buddha asked the same question.




For a third time, the mendicants kept silent.

Then it occurred to the Buddha,
# NOTE: Reading te va as in PTS. Here the Buddha switches from addressing the monks as a whole to addressing just Anuruddha and his friends, as indicated by the plural vocative anuruddhā as opposed to bhikkhave above.
“Why don’t I question just those gentlemen?”
Then the Buddha said to Venerable Anuruddha,
“Anuruddha and friends, I hope you’re satisfied with the spiritual life?”
“Indeed, sir, we are satisfied with the spiritual life.”

“Good, good, Anuruddha and friends!
It’s appropriate for gentlemen like yourselves, who have gone forth in faith from the lay life to homelessness, to be satisfied with the spiritual life.
Since you’re blessed with youth, in the prime of life, black-haired, you could have enjoyed sensual pleasures; yet you have gone forth from the lay life to homelessness.
But you didn’t go forth because you were forced to by kings or bandits, or because you’re in debt or threatened, or to earn a living.
Rather, didn’t you go forth thinking: ‘I’m swamped by rebirth, old age, and death; by sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. I’m swamped by suffering, mired in suffering.
Hopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of suffering’?”

“Yes, sir.”

“But, Anuruddha and friends, when a gentleman has gone forth like this, what should they do?
Take someone who doesn’t achieve the rapture and bliss that are secluded from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities, or something even more peaceful than that. Their mind is still occupied by desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, doubt, discontent, and sloth.
That’s someone who doesn’t achieve the rapture and bliss that are secluded from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities, or something even more peaceful than that.
Take someone who does achieve the rapture and bliss that are secluded from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities, or something even more peaceful than that. Their mind is not occupied by desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, doubt, discontent, and sloth.
That’s someone who does achieve the rapture and bliss that are secluded from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities, or something even more peaceful than that.

Is this what you think of me?
‘The Realized One has not given up the defilements, the corruptions that lead to future lives and are hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death.
That’s why, after reflection, he uses some things, endures some things, avoids some things, and gets rid of some things.’”
“No sir, we don’t think of you that way.


We think of you this way:
‘The Realized One has given up the defilements, the corruptions that lead to future lives and are hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death.
That’s why, after reflection, he uses some things, endures some things, avoids some things, and gets rid of some things.’”
“Good, good, Anuruddha and friends!
The Realized One has given up the defilements, the corruptions that lead to future lives and are hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death. He has cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them so they are unable to arise in the future.
Just as a palm tree with its crown cut off is incapable of further growth,
in the same way, the Realized One has given up the defilements so they are unable to arise in the future.
That’s why, after reflection, he uses some things, endures some things, avoids some things, and gets rid of some things.

What do you think, Anuruddha and friends?
What advantage does the Realized One see in declaring the rebirth of his disciples who have passed away:
‘This one is reborn here, while that one is reborn there’?”
“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and our refuge. Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”

“The Realized One does not declare such things for the sake of deceiving people or flattering them, nor for the benefit of possessions, honor, or popularity, nor thinking, ‘So let people know about me!’

Rather, there are gentlemen of faith who are full of sublime joy and gladness.
When they hear that, they apply their minds to that end.
That is for their lasting welfare and happiness.

Take a monk who hears this:
‘The monk named so-and-so has passed away.

had such ethics, such qualities, such wisdom, such meditation, or such freedom.
Recollecting that monk’s faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom, he applies his mind to that end.
That’s how a monk lives at ease.

That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, Venerable Anuruddha and friends were happy with what the Buddha said.
