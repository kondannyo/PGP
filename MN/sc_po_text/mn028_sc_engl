The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint 

So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
There Sāriputta addressed the mendicants, 
“Reverends, mendicants!” 
“Reverend,” they replied. 
Sāriputta said this: 

“The footprints of all creatures that walk can fit inside an elephant’s footprint, so an elephant’s footprint is said to be the biggest of them all. 
In the same way, all skillful qualities can be included in the four noble truths. 
What four? 
The noble truths of suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering. 

And what is the noble truth of suffering? 
Rebirth is suffering; old age is suffering; death is suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress are suffering; not getting what you wish for is suffering. In brief, the five grasping aggregates are suffering. 
And what are the five grasping aggregates? 
They are as follows: the grasping aggregates of form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. 

And what is the grasping aggregate of form? 
The four primary elements, and form derived from the four primary elements. 

And what are the four primary elements? 
The elements of earth, water, fire, and air. 

And what is the earth element? 
The earth element may be interior or exterior. 
And what is the interior earth element? 
# NOTE: NOTE: Adopting Brahmali’s “organic” for upadinna. Note that most of what follows are, in fact “organs”.
Anything hard, solid, and organic that’s internal, pertaining to an individual. This includes: 
head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, undigested food, feces, or anything else hard, solid, and organic that’s internal, pertaining to an individual. 
This is called the interior earth element. 
The interior earth element and the exterior earth element are just the earth element. 
This should be truly seen with right understanding like this: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ 
When you truly see with right understanding, you grow disillusioned with the earth element, detaching the mind from the earth element. 

There comes a time when the exterior water element flares up. 
At that time the exterior earth element vanishes. 
So for all its great age, the earth element will be revealed as impermanent, liable to end, vanish, and perish. 
# NOTE: NOTE: For this idiomatic use of atha kho in a sentence, compare DN 23, Kiñcāpi bhavaṃ kassapo evamāha, atha kho evaṃ me ettha hoti. This sentence is difficult, and the punctuation is MS is improbable. https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/on-one-sentence-of-the-greater-elephant-footprint/3928
What then of this short-lived body derived from craving? Rather than take it to be ‘I’ or ‘mine’ or ‘I am’, they still just consider it to be none of these things. 

If others abuse, attack, harass, and trouble that mendicant, they understand: 
‘This painful feeling born of ear contact has arisen in me. 
That’s dependent, not independent. 
Dependent on what? 
Dependent on contact.’ 
They see that contact, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are impermanent. 
# NOTE: NOTE: Nyanamoli/BB’s “objective basis” is an unwarranted intrusion of abhidhamma ideas. This set of verbs always occur together and there is no need to treat them any other way here. arammana in the EBTs typically means something close to “meditation subject”. It’s used in the sense of the contemplative practice, relying on which, the desired outcome is achieved.
Based on that element alone, their mind becomes eager, confident, settled, and decided. 

Others might treat that mendicant with disliking, loathing, and detestation, 
striking them with fists, stones, sticks, and swords. 
They understand: 
‘This body is such that fists, stones, sticks, and swords strike it. 
But the Buddha has said in the Simile of the Saw: 
“Even if low-down bandits were to sever you limb from limb, anyone who had a malevolent thought on that account would not be following my instructions.” 
My energy shall be roused up and unflagging, my mindfulness established and lucid, my body tranquil and undisturbed, and my mind immersed in samādhi. 
Gladly now, let fists, stones, sticks, and swords strike this body! For this is how the instructions of the Buddhas are followed.’ 

While recollecting the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha in this way, equanimity based on the skillful may not become stabilized in them. 
In that case they stir up a sense of urgency: 
‘It’s my loss, my misfortune, 
that while recollecting the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha in this way, equanimity based on the skillful does not become stabilized in me.’ 
They’re like a daughter-in-law who stirs up a sense of urgency when they see their father-in-law. 
 
 
But if, while recollecting the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha in this way, equanimity based on the skillful does become stabilized in them, they’re happy with that. 
At this point, much has been done by that mendicant. 

And what is the water element? 
The water element may be interior or exterior. 
And what is the interior water element? 
Anything that’s water, watery, and organic that’s internal, pertaining to an individual. This includes: 
bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, synovial fluid, urine, or anything else that’s water, watery, and organic that’s internal, pertaining to an individual. 
This is called the interior water element. 
The interior water element and the exterior water element are just the water element. 
This should be truly seen with right understanding like this: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ 
When you truly see with right understanding, you grow disillusioned with the water element, detaching the mind from the water element. 
# NOTE: NOTE: Older translations take this in the sense “gets angry”, while BB and Thanissaro have “disturbed, agitated”. the former is unjustified as the elements are not personalized, while the latter is too weak. The term is only used, here and AN 5.197, in the sense of a sudden destructive expansion or inflation; note that the term is not used for the next passage, where there is a diminution.

There comes a time when the exterior water element flares up. 
It sweeps away villages, towns, cities, countries, and regions. 
There comes a time when the water in the ocean sinks down a hundred leagues, or two, three, four, five, six, up to seven hundred leagues. 
There comes a time when the water in the ocean stands just seven palm trees deep, or six, five, four, three, two, or even just one palm tree deep. 
There comes a time when the water in the ocean stands just seven fathoms deep, or six, five, four, three, two, or even just one fathom deep. 
There comes a time when the water in the ocean stands just half a fathom deep, or waist deep, or knee deep, or even just ankle deep. 
There comes a time when there isn’t enough water in the ocean even to wet the tip of your finger. 
So for all its great age, the water element will be revealed as impermanent, liable to end, vanish, and perish. 
What then of this short-lived body produced by craving? Rather than take it to be ‘I’ or ‘mine’ or ‘I am’, they still just consider it to be none of these things. … 
If, while recollecting the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha in this way, equanimity based on the skillful does become stabilized in them, they’re happy with that. 
At this point, much has been done by that mendicant. 

And what is the fire element? 
The fire element may be interior or exterior. 
And what is the interior fire element? 
Anything that’s fire, fiery, and organic that’s internal, pertaining to an individual. This includes: 
that which warms, that which ages, that which heats you up when feverish, that which properly digests food and drink, or anything else that’s fire, fiery, and organic that’s internal, pertaining to an individual. 
This is called the interior fire element. 
The interior fire element and the exterior fire element are just the fire element. 
This should be truly seen with right understanding like this: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ 
When you truly see with right understanding, you grow disillusioned with the fire element, detaching the mind from the fire element. 

There comes a time when the exterior fire element flares up. 
It burns up villages, towns, cities, countries, and regions until 
it reaches a green field, a roadside, a cliff’s edge, a body of water, or cleared parkland, where it’s extinguished for lack of fuel. 
There comes a time when they go looking for a fire, taking just chicken feathers and strips of sinew as kindling. 
So for all its great age, the fire element will be revealed as impermanent, liable to end, vanish, and perish. 
What then of this short-lived body derived from craving? Rather than take it to be ‘I’ or ‘mine’ or ‘I am’, they still just consider it to be none of these things. …

And what is the air element? 
The air element may be interior or exterior. 
And what is the interior air element? 
Anything that’s wind, windy, and organic that’s internal, pertaining to an individual. This includes: 
winds that go up or down, winds in the belly or the bowels, winds that flow through the limbs, in-breaths and out-breaths, or anything else that’s wind, windy, and organic that’s internal, pertaining to an individual. 
This is called the interior air element. 
The interior air element and the exterior air element are just the air element. 
This should be truly seen with right understanding like this: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ 
When you truly see with right understanding, you reject the air element, detaching the mind from the air element. 

There comes a time when the exterior air element flares up. 
It sweeps away villages, towns, cities, countries, and regions. 
There comes a time, in the last month of summer, when they look for wind by using a palm-leaf or fan, and even the grasses in the drip-fringe of a thatch roof don’t stir. 
So for all its great age, the air element will be revealed as impermanent, liable to end, vanish, and perish. 
What then of this short-lived body derived from craving? Rather than take it to be ‘I’ or ‘mine’ or ‘I am’, they still just consider it to be none of these things. …

When a space is enclosed by sticks, creepers, grass, and mud it becomes known as a ‘building’. 
In the same way, when a space is enclosed by bones, sinews, flesh, and skin it becomes known as a ‘form’. 
Reverends, though the eye is intact internally, so long as exterior sights don’t come into range and there’s no corresponding engagement, there’s no manifestation of the corresponding type of consciousness. 

Though the eye is intact internally and exterior sights come into range, so long as there’s no corresponding engagement, there’s no manifestation of the corresponding type of consciousness. 
But when the eye is intact internally and exterior sights come into range and there is corresponding engagement, there is the manifestation of the corresponding type of consciousness. 
The form produced in this way is included in the grasping aggregate of form. The feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness produced in this way are each included in the corresponding grasping aggregate. 
They understand: 
‘So this is how there comes to be inclusion, gathering together, and joining together into these five grasping aggregates. 
But the Buddha has said: 
“One who sees dependent origination sees the teaching. 
One who sees the teaching sees dependent origination.” 
And these five grasping aggregates are indeed dependently originated. 
The desire, adherence, attraction, and attachment for these five grasping aggregates is the origin of suffering. 
Giving up and getting rid of desire and greed for these five grasping aggregates is the cessation of suffering.’ 
At this point, much has been done by that mendicant. 
Though the ear … 
nose … 
tongue … 
body … 

mind is intact internally, so long as exterior thoughts don’t come into range and there’s no corresponding engagement, there’s no manifestation of the corresponding type of consciousness.

That’s what Venerable Sāriputta said. 
Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what Sāriputta said.
