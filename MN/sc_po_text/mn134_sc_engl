Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night 

So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
Now at that time Venerable Lomasakaṅgiya was staying in the Sakyan country at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery. 

Then, late at night, the glorious god Candana, lighting up the entire Banyan Tree Monastery, went up to the Venerable Lomasakaṅgiya, and stood to one side. Standing to one side, he said to Lomasakaṅgiya: 
“Mendicant, do you remember the recitation passage and analysis of One Fine Night?” 
“No, reverend, I do not. 
Do you?” 
“I also do not. 
But do you remember just the verses on One Fine Night?” 
“I do not. 
Do you?” 
“I do.” 
“How do you remember the verses on One Fine Night?” 
# NOTE: pandukambala is regularly given in the list of luxury upholserty.
“This one time, the Buddha was staying among the gods of the Thirty-Three at the root of the Shady Orchard Tree on the stone spread with a cream rug. 
There he taught the recitation passage and analysis of One Fine Night to the gods of the Thirty-Three: 

‘Don’t run back to the past, 
don’t hope for the future. 
What’s past is left behind; 
the future has not arrived; 
and phenomena in the present 
are clearly seen in every case. 
Knowing this, foster it—
unfaltering, unshakable. 
Today’s the day to keenly work—
who knows, tomorrow may bring death! 
For there is no bargain to be struck 
with Death and his mighty hordes. 
The peaceful sage explained it’s those 
who keenly meditate like this, 
tireless all night and day, 
who truly have that one fine night.’ 

That’s how I remember the verses of One Fine Night. 
Learn the recitation passage and analysis of One Fine Night, mendicant, 
memorize it, 
and remember it. 
It is beneficial and relates to the fundamentals of the spiritual life.” 
That’s what the god Candana said 
before vanishing right there. 

Then Lomasakaṅgiya set his lodgings in order and, taking his bowl and robe, set out for Sāvatthī. 
Eventually he came to Sāvatthī and Jeta’s Grove. He went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. Then he added: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
“Sir, please teach me the recitation passage and analysis of One Fine night.” 

“But mendicant, do you know that god?” 
“I do not, sir.” 
“That god was named Candana. 
Candana pays heed, pays attention, engages wholeheartedly, and lends an ear to the teaching. 
Well then, mendicant, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 
“Yes, sir,” Lomasakaṅgiya replied. 
The Buddha said this: 

“Don’t run back to the past, 
don’t hope for the future. 
What’s past is left behind; 
the future has not arrived; 
and phenomena in the present 
are clearly seen in every case. 
Knowing this, foster it—
unfaltering, unshakable. 
Today’s the day to keenly work—
who knows, tomorrow may bring death! 
For there is no bargain to be struck 
with Death and his mighty hordes. 
The peaceful sage explained it’s those 
who keenly meditate like this, 
tireless all night and day, 
who truly have that one fine night. 
And how do you run back to the past? …” 
(And the Buddha repeated the analysis as in MN 131.) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
That is what the Buddha said. 
Satisfied, Venerable Lomasakaṅgiya was happy with what the Buddha said.
