Middle Discourses 62 
The Longer Advice to Rāhula 

So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 

Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms. 
And Venerable Rāhula also robed up and followed behind the Buddha. 

Then the Buddha looked back at Rāhula and said, 
“Rāhula, you should truly see any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’” 
“Only form, Blessed One? Only form, Holy One?” 
“Form, Rāhula, as well as feeling and perception and choices and consciousness.” 

Then Rāhula thought, “Who would go to the village for alms today after being advised directly by the Buddha?” Turning back, he sat down at the root of a certain tree cross-legged, with his body straight, and established mindfulness right there. 

Venerable Sāriputta saw him sitting there, 
and addressed him, 
“Rāhula, develop mindfulness of breathing. 
When mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated it’s very fruitful and beneficial.” 

Then in the late afternoon, Rāhula came out of retreat, went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 

“Sir, how is mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated to be very fruitful and beneficial?”

Rāhula, meditate like the earth. 
For when you meditate like the earth, pleasant and unpleasant contacts will not occupy your mind. 
Suppose they were to toss both clean and unclean things on the earth, like feces, urine, spit, pus, and blood. The earth isn’t horrified, repelled, and disgusted because of this. 
In the same way, meditate like the earth. 
For when you meditate like the earth, pleasant and unpleasant contacts will not occupy your mind. 

Meditate like water. 
For when you meditate like water, pleasant and unpleasant contacts will not occupy your mind.

# NOTE: BB translates this in line with the previous two, but in fact the syntax is the same as the next: tejo is the subject, the verb is singular, and there is no locative.
Suppose a fire were to burn both clean and unclean things, like feces, urine, spit, pus, and blood. The fire isn’t horrified, repelled, and disgusted because of this. 
In the same way, meditate like fire. 
For when you meditate like fire, pleasant and unpleasant contacts will not occupy your mind.

For when you meditate like wind, pleasant and unpleasant contacts will not occupy your mind. 

Meditate like space.

Just as space is not established anywhere, 
in the same way, meditate like space.

Develop mindfulness of breathing. 
When mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated it’s very fruitful and beneficial. 
And how is mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated to be very fruitful and beneficial? 

It’s when a mendicant—gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut—sits down cross-legged, with their body straight, and establishes mindfulness right there. 
Just mindful, they breath in. Mindful, they breath out. 

When breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ When breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’ 
When breathing in lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing in lightly.’ When breathing out lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing out lightly.’ 
They practice breathing in experiencing the whole body. They practice breathing out experiencing the whole body. 
They practice breathing in stilling the body’s motion. They practice breathing out stilling the body’s motion. 

They practice breathing in experiencing rapture. They practice breathing out experiencing rapture. 
They practice breathing in experiencing bliss. They practice breathing out experiencing bliss. 
They practice breathing in experiencing these emotions. They practice breathing out experiencing these emotions. 
They practice breathing in stilling these emotions. They practice breathing out stilling these emotions. 

They practice breathing in experiencing the mind. They practice breathing out experiencing the mind. 
They practice breathing in gladdening the mind. They practice breathing out gladdening the mind. 
They practice breathing in immersing the mind. They practice breathing out immersing the mind. 
They practice breathing in freeing the mind. They practice breathing out freeing the mind. 

They practice breathing in observing impermanence. They practice breathing out observing impermanence. 
They practice breathing in observing fading away. They practice breathing out observing fading away. 
They practice breathing in observing cessation. They practice breathing out observing cessation. 
They practice breathing in observing letting go. They practice breathing out observing letting go. 

Mindfulness of breathing, when developed and cultivated in this way, is very fruitful and beneficial. 
# NOTE: PTS’s assasapassasa must be correct, for why else is nirujjhanti plural?
When mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated in this way, even when the final breaths in and out cease, they are known, not unknown.” 
That is what the Buddha said. 
Satisfied, Venerable Rāhula was happy with what the Buddha said.
