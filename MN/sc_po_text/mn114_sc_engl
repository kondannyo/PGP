What Should and Should Not Be Cultivated
$1
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!”
“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:

“Mendicants, I will teach you an exposition of the teaching on what should and should not be cultivated.
Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:

“I say that there are two kinds of bodily behavior:
that which you should cultivate, and that which you should not cultivate.
# NOTE: I am not really sure of the force of this statement. Following comm., BB translates as “conduct is either the one or the other”, which to my mind is overburdening the text. It turns the statement into a strong affirmation of an ethical dualism, something that is avoided or outright repudiated elsewhere. Given that this passage appears to have no parallels, I would be reluctant to follow such a reading unless it was unavoidable.
And each of these is a kind of behavior.
I say that there are two kinds of verbal behavior:
that which you should cultivate, and that which you should not cultivate.
And each of these is a kind of behavior.
I say that there are two kinds of mental behavior:
that which you should cultivate, and that which you should not cultivate.
And each of these is a kind of behavior.
I say that there are two ways of giving rise to a thought:
that which you should cultivate, and that which you should not cultivate.
And each of these is a way of giving rise to a thought.
I say that there are two ways of acquiring perception:
that which you should cultivate, and that which you should not cultivate.
And each of these is a way of acquiring perception.
I say that there are two ways of acquiring views:
that which you should cultivate, and that which you should not cultivate.
And each of these is a way of acquiring views.
I say that there are two ways of reincarnating:
that which you should cultivate, and that which you should not cultivate.
And each of these is a way of reincarnating.”

“Sir, this is how I understand the detailed meaning of the Buddha’s brief statement.

They speak divisively. They repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other. And so they divide those who are harmonious, supporting division, delighting in division, loving division, speaking words that promote division.
They speak harshly. They use the kinds of words that are cruel, nasty, hurtful, offensive, bordering on anger, not leading to immersion.
