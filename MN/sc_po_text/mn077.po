# NOTE: The sense of yena dukkhena here was, I think, missed by previous translators, although Chalmers was closest: “when my disciples are beset by Ill, and spent with Ill in any particular shape”. Nyanamoli had “through some form of suffering”. BB has “met with suffering”. Horner omits entirely. The point is that the disciples ask about the noble truth of suffering (i.e. the abstract principle) in the case of “that dukkha because of which” (yena dukkhena, i.e. the specific instance of suffering that has affected them) they are overwhelmed. In other words, “the theoretical teaching of dukkha is one thing, but how does it help me deal with this actual suffering?” It’s a long, complex sentence, and I have broken it up and rendered it more idiomatically.
