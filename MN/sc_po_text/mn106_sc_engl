Middle Discourses 106 
Conducive to the Imperturbable 

So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kurus, near the Kuru town named Kammāsadamma. 
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, 
“Mendicants!” 
“Venerable sir,” they replied. 
The Buddha said this: 

“Mendicants, sensual pleasures are impermanent, hollow, false, and deceptive, 
# NOTE: balalapana is found at Thig 5.2 of a beautiful body, and at SN 22.95 we have balalapini, where BB has “beguiler of fools” noting that the comm says this refers to vinnana, although this doesn’t seem completely certain. At Ja 421 we have of kama: Ahahā bālalapanā, “Oh, oh, the cries of fools.” I think this context gives a good idea, it means something like “cooed over by fools”, or in the case of lapini, clumsily: “causing fools to coo over it.”
made by illusion, cooed over by fools. 
Sensual pleasures in this life and in lives to come, 
sensual perceptions in this life and in lives to come; 
both of these are Māra’s sovereignty, Māra’s domain, and Māra’s territory. 
They conduce to bad, unskillful qualities such as desire, ill will, and aggression. 
And they create an obstacle for a noble disciple training here. 

A noble disciple reflects on this: 
‘Sensual pleasures in this life and in lives to come, 
sensual perceptions in this life and in lives to come; 
both of these are Māra’s sovereignty, Māra’s domain, and Māra’s territory. 
They conduce to bad, unskillful qualities such as desire, ill will, and aggression. 
And they create an obstacle for a noble disciple training here. 
Why don’t I meditate with an abundant, expansive heart, having mastered the world and stabilized the mind? 
Then I will have no more bad, unskillful qualities such as desire, ill will, and aggression. 
And by giving them up my mind, no longer limited, will become limitless and well developed.’ 
Practicing in this way and meditating on it often their mind becomes confident in this dimension. 
# NOTE: MS punctuation is incorrect. The idioms here are odd. The comm gives an extensive and implausible explanation, which begins by proposing that the sequence of the text be reversed! Etarahi vā āneñjaṃ samāpajjati. Paññāya vā adhimuccatīti ettha etarahi vā paññāya adhimuccati, āneñjaṃ vā samāpajjatīti evaṃ padaparivattanaṃ katvā attho veditabbo. The Chinese at MA 75 has 以慧為解 “liberated by wisdom”, which is surely a more persuasive reading. I suggest there was an old corruption from vimuccati to adhimuccati. See https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/free-or-confident/2806
Being confident, they either attain the imperturbable now, or are freed by wisdom. 
# NOTE: Unfortunately, samvattanika doesn’t really mean “evolving”. The normal meaning of samvattanika is “leading on, conducive to”, and the point here is that the state of consciousness developed in meditation is conducive to such a rebirth.
When their body breaks up, after death, it’s possible that the consciousness headed that way will be reborn in the imperturbable. 
This is said to be the first way of practice suitable for attaining the imperturbable. 

Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects: 
‘Sensual pleasures in this life and in lives to come, 
sensual perceptions in this life and in lives to come; 
whatever is form, all form is the four primary elements, or form derived from the four primary elements.’

Being confident, they either attain the imperturbable now, or are freed by wisdom.

visions in this life and in lives to come, 
perceptions of visions in this life and in lives to come; 
all of these are impermanent. 
And what’s impermanent is not worth approving, welcoming, or clinging to.’ 
Practicing in this way and meditating on it often their mind becomes confident in this dimension. 
Being confident, they either attain the imperturbable now, or are freed by wisdom.

sensual perceptions in this life and in lives to come,

and perceptions of the imperturbable;

Where they cease without anything left over, that is peaceful, that is sublime, 
namely the dimension of nothingness.’

Furthermore, a noble disciple has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, and reflects like this: 
‘This is empty of a self or what belongs to a self.’

When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha: 
“Sir, take a mendicant who practices like this: 
‘It might not be, and it might not be mine. It will not be, and it will not be mine. I am giving up what exists, what has come to be.’ 
In this way they gain equanimity. 
Would that mendicant become extinguished or not?” 
“One such mendicant might become extinguished, Ānanda, while another might not.” 
“What is the cause, sir, what is the reason for this?” 
“Ānanda, take a mendicant who practices like this: 
‘It might not be, and it might not be mine. It will not be, and it will not be mine. I am giving up what exists, what has come to be.’ 
In this way they gain equanimity. 
They approve, welcome, and keep clinging to that equanimity. 
Their consciousness relies on that and grasps it. 
A mendicant with grasping does not become extinguished.” 

“But sir, what is that mendicant grasping?” 
“The dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.” 
“Sir, it seems that mendicant is grasping the best thing to grasp!” 
“Indeed, Ānanda. 
For the best thing to grasp is 
the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. 

Take a mendicant who practices like this: 
‘It might not be, and it might not be mine. It will not be, and it will not be mine. I am giving up what exists, what has come to be.’ 
In this way they gain equanimity. 
They don’t approve, welcome, or keep clinging to that equanimity. 
So their consciousness doesn’t rely on that and grasp it. 
A mendicant free of grasping becomes extinguished.” 

“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing! 
The Buddha has explained to us how to cross over the flood by relying on one support or the other. 
But sir, what is noble liberation?” 
“Ananda, it’s when a mendicant reflects like this: 
‘Sensual pleasures in this life and in lives to come, 
sensual perceptions in this life and in lives to come, 
visions in this life and in lives to come, 
perceptions of visions in this life and in lives to come, 
perceptions of the imperturbable, perceptions of the dimension of nothingness, perceptions of the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception; 
that is identity as far as identity extends. 
This is the deathless, namely the liberation of the mind through not grasping. 

So, Ānanda, I have taught the ways of practice suitable for attaining the imperturbable, the dimension of nothingness, and the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. I have taught how to cross the flood by relying on one support or the other, and I have taught noble liberation. 

Out of compassion, I’ve done what a teacher should do who wants what’s best for their disciples. 
Here are these roots of trees, and here are these empty huts. Practice absorption, Ānanda! Don’t be negligent! Don’t regret it later! This is my instruction to you.” 
That is what the Buddha said. 
Satisfied, Venerable Ānanda was happy with what the Buddha said.
