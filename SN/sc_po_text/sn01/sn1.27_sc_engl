“From where do streams turn back?
Where does the cycle spin no more?
Where do name and form
cease with nothing left over?”
“Where water and earth,
fire and air find no footing.
From here the streams turn back;
here the cycle spins no more;
and here it is that name and form
cease with nothing left over.”
