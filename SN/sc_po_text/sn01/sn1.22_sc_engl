3. A Sword
22. Impact
“It doesn’t impact a person who doesn’t impact others.
It impacts a person because they impact others.
That’s why it impacts one who impacts,
who wrongs one who’s done no wrong.”
“Whoever wrongs a man who’s done no wrong,
a pure man who has not a blemish,
the evil backfires on the fool,
like fine dust thrown upwind.”
