saṃyutta nikāya 1
6. jarāvagga
54. vatthusutta
# NOTE: I think the underlying metaphor here is more concrete than “support”: it is a person’s lands, their property, which is their support and legacy. As usual, the Buddha’s response aims to upend conventional values.
“kiṃsu vatthu manussānaṃ,
kiṃsūdha paramo sakhā;
kiṃsu bhūtā upajīvanti,
ye pāṇā pathavissitā”ti.
“puttā vatthu manussānaṃ,
bhariyā ca paramo sakhā;
vuṭṭhiṃ bhūtā upajīvanti,
ye pāṇā pathavissitā”ti.
