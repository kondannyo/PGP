“How should provisions be tied up?
What’s the lair of wealth?
What drags a person around?
What in the world is hard to give up?
What are many beings tied up with,
like birds in a snare?”

Glory is the lair of wealth.
Desire drags a person around.
Desire in the world is hard to give up.
Many beings are tied up with desire,
like birds in a snare.”
