“How many lamps are there,
that shine their light on the world?
We’ve come to ask the Buddha;
how are we to understand this?”
“There are four lamps in the world,
a fifth is not found.
The sun shines by day,
the moon glows at night,
while a fire burns both
by day and by night.
But a Buddha is the best of lights:
this is the supreme radiance.”
