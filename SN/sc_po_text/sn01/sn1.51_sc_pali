saṃyutta nikāya 1
6. jarāvagga
51. jarāsutta
# NOTE: BB’s “until” suggests to me that sila is only good until you get old, which is surely not what was meant!
“kiṃsu yāva jarā sādhu,
kiṃsu sādhu patiṭṭhitaṃ;
kiṃsu narānaṃ ratanaṃ,
kiṃsu corehi dūharan”ti.
“sīlaṃ yāva jarā sādhu,
saddhā sādhu patiṭṭhitā;
paññā narānaṃ ratanaṃ,
puññaṃ corehi dūharan”ti.
