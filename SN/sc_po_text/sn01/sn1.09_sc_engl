1. A Reed
9. Fond of Conceit
At Sāvatthī.
Standing to one side, that deity recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence:
“Someone who’s fond of conceit can’t be tamed,
and someone lacking serenity can’t be a sage.
Living negligent alone in the wilderness,
they can’t pass beyond Death’s domain.”
“Having given up conceit, serene within oneself,
with a healthy heart, everywhere released;
living diligent alone in the wilderness,
they pass beyond Death’s domain.”
