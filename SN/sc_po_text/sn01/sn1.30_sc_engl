“O hero so lean, with antelope calves,
not greedy, eating little,
living alone like a lion or an elephant,
you’re not concerned for sensual pleasures.
We’ve come to ask a question:

“There are five kinds of sensual stimulation in the world,
and the mind is said to be the sixth.
When you’ve discarded desire for these,
you’re released from all suffering.”
