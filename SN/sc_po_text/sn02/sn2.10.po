# NOTE: I don’t buy the explanation that Rahu was a sotapanna and hence the Buddha’s spiritual son. I would be more sympathetic to the idea that this is a reference to the Buddha’s solar lineage, and would adopt such a rendering without hesitation, if it were not for the fact that pajam means “progeny”, not “kin”. Neither in Pali nor in Sanskrit can I find support for such a usage. In fact, I think this line, like the use of “sambadha” in the Canda verses, is a garbled allusion to a fertility myth. Rahu is pregnant with the sun and must give birth. Whether by accident or design the Buddhist editors lost sight of this metaphor.
