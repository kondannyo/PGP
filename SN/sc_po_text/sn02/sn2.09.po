# NOTE: The is the only use of the phrase gāthābhigīta apart from the well-known passage where the Buddha refused to eat what had been “chanted over” by brahmins. PTS dict (and Mil 5.5.9?) take the term to mean “obtained by chanting”, but this context shows that this can’t be correct. The common factor is that it evokes a powerful magical effect: splitting of heads, or boiling of water. CPD gets it right: “conjured (by a potent spell)”. The difference is exactly similar to that between “chanted” and “enchanted”. See https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/on-chanting-and-enchanting/3376
