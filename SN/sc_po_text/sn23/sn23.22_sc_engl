22. Liable To Cease
At Sāvatthī.
Seated to one side, Venerable Rādha said to the Buddha:
“Sir, they speak of things being ‘liable to cease’.
What is liable to cease?”
“Rādha, form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are liable to cease.
Seeing this …
They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’”
