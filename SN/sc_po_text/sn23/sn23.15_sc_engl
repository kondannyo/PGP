15. Suffering
At Sāvatthī.
Seated to one side, Venerable Rādha said to the Buddha:
“Sir, they speak of this thing called ‘suffering’.
What is suffering?”
“Rādha, form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are suffering.
Seeing this …
They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’”
