2. About Māra (2nd)
20. Liable To Vanish
At Sāvatthī.
Seated to one side, Venerable Rādha said to the Buddha:
“Sir, they speak of things being ‘liable to vanish’.
What is liable to vanish?”
“Rādha, form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are liable to vanish.
Seeing this …
They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’”
