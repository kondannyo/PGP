At Sāvatthī.
“Mendicants, these eight things don’t arise to be developed and cultivated except when a Realized One, a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha has appeared.
What eight?
They are: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.
These eight things don’t arise to be developed and cultivated except when a Realized One, a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha has appeared.”
