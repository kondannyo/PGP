“Mendicants, there are five lower fetters.
What five?
Identity view, doubt, misapprehension of precepts and observances, sensual desire, and ill will.
These are the five lower fetters.
The noble eightfold path should be developed for the direct knowledge, complete understanding, finishing, and giving up of these five lowers fetters.”
