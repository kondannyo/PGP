At Sāvatthī.
“Mendicants, these eight things don’t arise to be developed and cultivated apart from the Holy One’s training.
What eight?
They are: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.
These are the eight things that don’t arise to be developed and cultivated apart from the Holy One’s training.”
