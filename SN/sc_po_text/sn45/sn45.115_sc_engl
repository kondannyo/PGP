115. Slanting East
“Mendicants, the Ganges river slants, slopes, and inclines to the east.
In the same way, a mendicant who develops and cultivates the noble eightfold path slants, slopes, and inclines to extinguishment.
And how does a mendicant who develops the noble eightfold path slant, slope, and incline to extinguishment?
It’s when a mendicant develops right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion, which culminate, finish, and end in the deathless.
That’s how a mendicant who develops and cultivates the noble eightfold path slants, slopes, and inclines to extinguishment.”
