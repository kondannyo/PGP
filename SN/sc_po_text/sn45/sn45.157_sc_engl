“Mendicants, when a large storm has arisen, a strong wind disperses and settles it as it proceeds.
In the same way, a mendicant who develops and cultivates the noble eightfold path disperses and stills bad, unskillful qualities as they proceed.
And how does a mendicant who develops the noble eightfold path disperse and still bad, unskillful qualities as they proceed?
It’s when a mendicant develops right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go.
That’s how a mendicant who develops and cultivates the noble eightfold path disperses and stills bad, unskillful qualities as they proceed.”
