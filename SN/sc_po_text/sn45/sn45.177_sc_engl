“Mendicants, there are these five hindrances.
What five?
The hindrances of sensual desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt.
These are the five hindrances.
The noble eightfold path should be developed for the direct knowledge, complete understanding, finishing, and giving up of these five hindrances.”
