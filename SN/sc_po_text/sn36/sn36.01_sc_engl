“Mendicants, there are these three feelings.
What three?
Pleasant, painful, and neutral feeling.
These are the three feelings.
With immersion and situational awareness,
a mindful disciple of the Buddha
understands feelings,
the cause of feelings,
where they cease,
and the path that leads to their ending.
With the ending of feelings, a mendicant
is hungerless, extinguished.”
