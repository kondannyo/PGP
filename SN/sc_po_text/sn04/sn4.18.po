# NOTE: BB has “the gift-festival of the young people was being held”. This follows the comm. While this is possible, I prefer to follow the principle of least meaning; creating an entire festival out of one word, while charming, makes it bear a great weight. One of the few other uses of pāhunaka is at Mil 5.1.2. There, the story goes that when a guest arrives after the food is used up, and special food must be prepared for them. The host/guest relationship is expressed in dative/genitive, as here, and the similar subject matter suggests a connection. I think the point here is that the women who might normally prepare food were otherwise occupied. This gives a straightforward sense to the sutta; otherwise it is hard to say why the fact that young people were giving each other flowers has anything to do with ascetics collecting alms. Also, I prefer the feminine kumarika here as being more specific.
