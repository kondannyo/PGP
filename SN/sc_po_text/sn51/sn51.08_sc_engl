“Mendicants, there are these four bases of psychic power.
What four?
It’s when a mendicant develops the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to enthusiasm …
energy …
mental development …
inquiry, and active effort.
These are the four bases of psychic power.
It is because he has developed and cultivated these four bases of psychic power that the Realized One is called ‘the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha’.”
