40. In Line with the Teachings (2nd)
At Sāvatthī.
“Mendicants, when a mendicant is practicing in line with the teachings, this is what’s in line with the teachings. They should live observing impermanence in form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. …
They’re freed from suffering, I say.”
