3. The Burden
32. The Breakable
At Sāvatthī.
“Mendicants, I will teach you the breakable and the unbreakable.
Listen …
And what is the breakable? What is the unbreakable?
Form is breakable,
but its cessation, settling, and ending is unbreakable.
Feeling …

perception …
choices …

consciousness is breakable,
but its cessation, settling, and ending is unbreakable.”
