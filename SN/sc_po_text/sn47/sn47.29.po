# NOTE: This idiom appears in SN 47.29, SN 55.3, SN 55.39 as well as MN 129. In MN it is behaviors, whereas in SN it is mostly inner qualities. If it was mostly external qualities, I would be inclined to translate literally in the sense of “I am seen engaging in these things, i.e.” I exhibit these things “. But as inner qualities, it seems more like a reflective idiom, where the parallelism of the phrases, rather then being stricttly literal, is meant in the sense of” I fully embody these things". Anyway, I translate literally.
