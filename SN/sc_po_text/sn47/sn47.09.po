# NOTE: BB has “shade behind the dwelling”, evidently accepting PTS’s vihārapacchāchāyāyaṃ. However vihāra­pacchā­yā­yaṃ occurs in several other similar contexts, without variants that I know of. The Buddha would regularly receive visitors there, so it meant something more than just the dwelling’s shade; it must have been a covered area outside the hut, i.e. a porch.
