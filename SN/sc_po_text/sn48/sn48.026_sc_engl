3. The Six Faculties
26. A Stream-Enterer
“Mendicants, there are these six faculties.
What six?
The faculties of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind.
A noble disciple comes to truly understand these six faculties’ origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape.
Such a noble disciple is called a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.”
