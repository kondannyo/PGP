3. The Six Faculties
27. A Perfected One
“Mendicants, there are these six faculties.
What six?
The faculties of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind.
A mendicant comes to be freed by not grasping after truly understanding these six faculties’ origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape.
Such a mendicant is called a perfected one, with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and is rightly freed through enlightenment.”
