14. Fear of the Bad Place
“Mendicants, a noble disciple who has four things has gone beyond all fear of being reborn in a bad place.
What four?
It’s when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha …

the teaching …
the Saṅgha …
And they have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion.
A noble disciple who has these four things has gone beyond all fear of being reborn in a bad place.”
