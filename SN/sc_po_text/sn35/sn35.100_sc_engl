“Mendicants, meditate in retreat.
A mendicant in retreat truly understands.
What do they truly understand?
They truly understand that the eye is impermanent.
They truly understand that sights …
eye consciousness …
eye contact …
the pleasant, painful, or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by mind contact is impermanent.
Mendicants, meditate in retreat.
A mendicant in retreat truly understands.”
