16. The End of Relishing
167. Giving Up View of Self
Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha …
and said to him:
“Sir, how does one know and see so that view of self is given up?”
“Mendicant, knowing and seeing the eye, sights, eye consciousness, and eye contact as not-self, view of self is given up. …









And also knowing and seeing the pleasant, painful, or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by mind contact as not-self, view of self is given up.”
