186. The Interior Was Impermanent in the Past
“Mendicants, in the past the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind were impermanent.
Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind.
Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.
They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’”
