1. Gods of the Clouds
53. Gods of the Cool Clouds
At Sāvatthī.
Seated to one side, that mendicant said to the Buddha:
“Sir, what is the cause, what is the reason why sometimes it becomes cool?”
“Mendicant, there are what are called gods of the cool clouds.
Sometimes they think:
‘Why don’t we revel in our own kind of enjoyment?’ Then, in accordance with their wish, it becomes cool.
This is the cause, this is the reason why sometimes it becomes cool.”
