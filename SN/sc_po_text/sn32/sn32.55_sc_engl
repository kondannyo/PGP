1. Gods of the Clouds
55. Gods of the Storm Clouds
At Sāvatthī.
Seated to one side, that mendicant said to the Buddha:
“Sir, what is the cause, what is the reason why sometimes it becomes stormy?”
“Mendicant, there are what are called gods of the storm clouds.
Sometimes they think:
‘Why don’t we revel in our own kind of enjoyment?’ Then, in accordance with their wish, it becomes stormy.
This is the cause, this is the reason why sometimes it becomes stormy.”
