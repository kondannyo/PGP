1. Gods of the Clouds
56. Gods of the Windy Clouds
At Sāvatthī.
Seated to one side, that mendicant said to the Buddha:
“Sir, what is the cause, what is the reason why sometimes it becomes windy?”
“Mendicant, there are what are called gods of the windy clouds.
Sometimes they think:
‘Why don’t we revel in our own kind of enjoyment?’ Then, in accordance with their wish, it becomes windy.
This is the cause, this is the reason why sometimes it becomes windy.”
