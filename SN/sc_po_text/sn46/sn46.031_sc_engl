“Mendicants, whatever qualities are skillful, part of the skillful, on the side of the skillful, all of them are rooted in diligence and meet at diligence, and diligence is said to be the best of them.
A mendicant who is diligent can expect to develop and cultivate the seven awakening factors.
And how does a diligent mendicant develop and cultivate the seven awakening factors?
It’s when a mendicant develops the awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion, and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go.
That’s how a diligent mendicant develops and cultivates the seven awakening factors.”
