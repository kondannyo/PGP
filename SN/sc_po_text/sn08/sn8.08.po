# NOTE: Here BB, following Norman, prefers to read sattama as the superlative of sant. The problem is that this term appears to be restricted to this specific usage, which is hard to explain otherwise. Since sattama as superlative of sant is rare or absent elsewhere, while sattama as seventh is common, it seems that a strong argument is required to justify this reading. But so far as I can tell, the argument is, “I can’t imagine why a mythical term would be used”. Lacking a stronger argument, I translate as “seventh sage”.
