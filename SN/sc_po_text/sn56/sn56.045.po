# NOTE: BB has “head through butt”, which apart from the double entendre, is perhaps overly literal. While “ponkha” means “feathered shaft”, the expression poṅkhānupoṅkha is treated in the Niddesas as a standard synonym meaning “repeatedly, continuously”. Hence I chose “shot after shot” as somewhere between a literal and figurative expression.

# NOTE: BB translates the second question as if it refers to archery, but nothing in the vocabulary suggests this. Koti, of course, could refer to an arrow’s point, but it is not a standard term. Also, it seems odd to take the phrase kotiya kotim to refer to two completely different kinds of things. This transl. seems to follow the comm too closely. I follow Thanissaro’s suggestion.
