# NOTE: See BB’s note on “dhamma” here. Given the context (Anuruddha’s psychic power) I think his suggestion that we interpret in line with AN 3.76 is a good one. If this is the case, then here dhamma=dhatu=loka. I have preserved the parallelism in the translations, even though the terminology of the Pali is slightly different (dhamma vs. dhatu).
