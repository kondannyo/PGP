2. The Second Chapter
14. Mother
At Sāvatthī.
“Mendicants, transmigration has no known beginning. …
It’s not easy to find a sentient being who in all this long time has not previously been your mother.
Why is that?
Transmigration has no known beginning. …
This is quite enough for you to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed regarding all conditions.”
