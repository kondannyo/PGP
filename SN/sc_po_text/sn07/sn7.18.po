# NOTE: Comm explains tidiva as the Brahma realm, which contradicts what I said in my note on SN3.21, that tidiva is essentially a compressed version of tavatimsa. But this doesn’t really apply: comm is fitting the text into the Buddhist cosmology, while the brahmin is not. For a start, he thinks tapas is the way to Brahma. Rather than fitting the text into a later set of cosmological assumptions, it is better to preserve the text as an interesting insight into one approach to brahmanical cosmology at the time. Evidently the threefold heaven, or the thirty-three, was a generic name for heaven, cp the Trinity, etc. It is in this primitive sense that the brahmin is talking, and in a similarly primitive sense that he assumes Brahma is the lord of this heaven, this is not a literal reference to the same deity spoken of in the Buddhist texts, but a generic reference tio the highets deity.
