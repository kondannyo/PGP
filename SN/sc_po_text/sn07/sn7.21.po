# NOTE: This is a very precise and clear statement of the pre-Buddhist quasi-physical understanding of good and evil. Such practices, which are detailed further in the Jatakas, clearly relate to magical thinking. Evidently such quasi-material thinking was shared between the Brahmins (at least some of them) and the Jains.
