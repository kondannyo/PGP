At Sāvatthī.
“Mendicants, desire and greed for form, feeling, perception, choices, or consciousness is a corruption of the mind.
When a mendicant has given up mental corruption in these five cases, their mind inclines to renunciation.
A mind imbued with renunciation is declared to be capable of directly knowing anything that can be realized.”
