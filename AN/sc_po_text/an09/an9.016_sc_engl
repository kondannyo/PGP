16. Perceptions
“Mendicants, these nine perceptions, when developed and cultivated, are very fruitful and beneficial. They culminate in the deathless and end with the deathless.
What nine?
The perceptions of ugliness, death, repulsiveness of food, dissatisfaction with the whole world, impermanence, suffering in impermanence, not-self in suffering, giving up, and fading away.
These nine perceptions, when developed and cultivated, are very fruitful and beneficial. They culminate in the deathless and end with the deathless.”
