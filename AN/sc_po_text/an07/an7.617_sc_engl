“Mendicants, for insight into greed, seven things should be developed.
What seven?
The perceptions of ugliness, death, repulsiveness of food, dissatisfaction with the whole world, impermanence, suffering in impermanence, and not-self in suffering.
These seven things should be developed for insight into greed.”
