5. A Great Sacrifice
46. Fires (1st)
“Mendicants, there are these seven fires.
What seven?
The fires of greed, hate, delusion. The fire of those worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods. A householder’s fire. The fire of those worthy of a religious donation. And a wood fire.
These are the seven fires.”
