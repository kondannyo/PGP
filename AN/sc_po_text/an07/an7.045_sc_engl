# NOTE: BB has “accessories” for parikkhara, which is incorrect. An accessory is something optional, alankara in Pali. This is talking about things that are essential, not decorative. The normal meaning of parikkhara is, of course, the “necessities” of life, where once again it is employed in the sense of the things that make life possible, not those that make it fun.
“Mendicants, there are these seven prerequisites for immersion.
What seven?
Right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, and right mindfulness.
Unification of mind with these seven factors as prerequisites is called noble right immersion ‘with its vital conditions’ and ‘with its prerequisites’.”
