“Mendicants, a mendicant with seven qualities masters their mind and is not mastered by it.
What seven?
# NOTE: Reading kallitakusala with AN 6.24
It’s when a mendicant is skilled at immersion, skilled in entering immersion, skilled in remaining in immersion, skilled in emerging from immersion, skilled in gladdening the mind for immersion, skilled in the mindfulness meditation subjects for immersion, and skilled in projecting the mind purified by immersion.
A mendicant with these seven qualities masters their mind and is not mastered by it.”
