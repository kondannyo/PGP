aṅguttara nikāya 7
5. mahāyaññavagga
45. samādhiparikkhārasutta
# NOTE: BB has “accessories” for parikkhara, which is incorrect. An accessory is something optional, alankara in Pali. This is talking about things that are essential, not decorative. The normal meaning of parikkhara is, of course, the “necessities” of life, where once again it is employed in the sense of the things that make life possible, not those that make it fun.
“sattime, bhikkhave, samādhiparikkhārā.
katame satta?
sammādiṭṭhi, sammāsaṅkappo, sammāvācā, sammākammanto, sammāājīvo, sammāvāyāmo, sammāsati.
yā kho, bhikkhave, imehi sattahaṅgehi cittassekaggatā parikkhatā, ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, ariyo sammāsamādhi saupaniso itipi saparikkhāro itipī”ti.
dutiyaṃ.
