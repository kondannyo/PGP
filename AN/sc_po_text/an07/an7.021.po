# NOTE: The word “rape” traditionally means to forcible abduct a woman, and has only latterly come to have exclusively sense of sexual violence. In this context it is clear that sexual violence is intended so we should use the actual word. As far as I know, this is the earliest statement anywhere in the world that not only condemns rape, but makes the connection between abolishing violence against women and the prosperity of a society.
