# NOTE: I think BB’s “might focus on as earth” is too weak. It’s no great feat to focus on a specific aspect of things and tune other aspects out. I can do it. Heck, anyone who gets absorbed in a TV show does it. Surely this means something rather more dramatic. Else why does it take a monk who is master of psychic powers? CPD has “to make a (magical) act of volition”, and while I would disagree that it’s magical, it’s at least getting there.
