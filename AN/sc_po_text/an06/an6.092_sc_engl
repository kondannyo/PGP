92. Things That Can’t Be Done (1st)
“Mendicants, these six things can’t be done.
What six?
A person accomplished in view can’t live disrespectful and irreverent toward the Teacher, the teaching, the Saṅgha, or the training. They can’t establish their belief on unreliable grounds. And they can’t generate an eighth rebirth.
These are the six things that can’t be done.”
