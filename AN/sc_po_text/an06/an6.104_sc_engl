10. Benefit
104. Non-identification
“Mendicants, seeing six benefits is quite enough to establish the perception of not-self in all things without qualification.
What six?
‘I will be without identification in the whole world.’ ‘My I-makings will stop.’ ‘My mine-makings will stop.’ ‘I will have unshared knowledge.’ ‘I will clearly see causes and the phenomena that arise from causes.’
Seeing these six benefits is quite enough to establish the perception of not-self in all things without qualification.”
