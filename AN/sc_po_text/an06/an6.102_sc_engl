102. Transience
“Mendicants, seeing six benefits is quite enough to establish the perception of impermanence in all conditions without qualification.
What six?
‘All conditions will appear to me as transient.’ ‘My mind will not delight anywhere in the world.’ ‘My mind will rise above the whole world.’ ‘My mind will incline to extinguishment.’ ‘My fetters will be given up.’ ‘I will achieve the ultimate goal of the ascetic life.’
Seeing these six benefits is quite enough to establish the perception of impermanence in all conditions without qualification.”
