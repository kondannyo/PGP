230. Witless
“A foolish person … makes much bad karma. … They’re faithless, unethical, lazy, and witless. … An astute person … makes much merit. … They’re faithful, ethical, energetic, and wise.
When an astute, competent good person has these four qualities they keep themselves healthy and whole. They don’t deserve to be blamed and criticized by sensible people, and they make much merit.”
