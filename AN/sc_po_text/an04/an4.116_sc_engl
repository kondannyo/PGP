12. With Kesi
116. Diligence
“Mendicants, you should be diligent in four situations.
What four?
Give up bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind; and develop good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind.
Don’t neglect these things.




Give up wrong view; and develop right view.
Don’t neglect this.
A mendicant who has done these things does not fear death in lives to come.”
