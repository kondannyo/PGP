# NOTE: Bodhisatta means either “awakening-being” or, more likely “one intent on awakening”. Whatever it means, it certainly doesn’t mean what the Buddhist traditions later took it to mean, so any translation is better than keeping the Pali.

msgstr "When the being intent on awakening passes away from the host of Joyful Gods, he’s conceived in his mother’s womb, mindful and aware. And then—in this world with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—an immeasurable, magnificent light appears, surpassing the glory of the gods. "

# NOTE: See https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/the-boundless-desolation-of-interstellar-space/2248 Ābhā nanubhonti is glossed in MN 79 as obhāsaṃ na vaḷañjanti. This is a difficult term, but acc. to PTS dict means “leave a mark”. In AN 4.127 the same phrase is glossed pabhā nappahonti, i.e. “light is ineffective”. Neither gloss supports “matches” or “reaches”.
