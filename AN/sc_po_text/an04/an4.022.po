# NOTE: This line is difficult, and I have rendered according to my main text rather than the Sinhala as with BB. Note that the Sinhala reading used by BB is a combination of the BJ and S readings here. I find BB’s rendering incomprehensible both in Pali and English. If “thiradhamma” refers to samadhi—which so far as I can tell it does nowhere else—then this is not really conveyed by “factors of firmness”. And how is one “restrained” in these? As BB points out, the line falls between sila and wisdom, and so should refer to samadhi in some way. I’ve taken my cue from saññata, which normally refers to sense restraint or similar, and this gives us a meaningful role for “dhammesu”; i.e., among distracting phenomena that you experience". This also falls in the right place in the gradual training.
