Numbered Discourses 4
23. Bad Conduct
223. Ungrateful
“When a foolish, incompetent bad person has four qualities they keep themselves broken and damaged. They deserve to be blamed and criticized by sensible people, and they make much bad karma.
What four?
Bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and being ungrateful and thankless.
An astute person … makes much merit. … Good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and being grateful and thankful. …”
