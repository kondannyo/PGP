“cattārome, bhikkhave, kavī.
katame cattāro?
# NOTE: I have no idea how BB gets “narrative” out of “suta”. It obviously refers to a poet who passes down the oral tradition (most of which, i.e. the Vedas, are not narrative at all). “Inspirational” is not as bad, but is unnecessarily ambiguous: do they inspire (which is the more common meaning, but shouldn’t apply here) or are they inspired? Even being inspired is not exactly what it means. You can give an inspired performance of a learned piece. What it means is that you make it up on the spot, i.e. improvise.
cintākavi, sutakavi, atthakavi, paṭibhānakavi—
ime kho, bhikkhave, cattāro kavī”ti.
ekādasamaṃ.
duccaritavaggo tatiyo.
duccaritaṃ diṭṭhi akataññū ca,
pāṇātipātāpi dve maggā;
dve vohārapathā vuttā,
ahirikaṃ duppaññakavinā cāti.
