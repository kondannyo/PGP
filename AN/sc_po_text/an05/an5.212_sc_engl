“Mendicants, a mendicant who starts arguments, quarrels, fights, debates, and disciplinary issues in the Saṅgha can expect five drawbacks.
What five?
They don’t achieve the unachieved. What they have achieved falls away. They get a bad reputation. They feel lost when they die. And when their body breaks up, after death, they are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
A mendicant who starts arguments, quarrels, fights, debates, and disciplinary issues in the Saṅgha can expect these five drawbacks.”
