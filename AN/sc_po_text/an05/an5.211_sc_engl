22. Abuse
211. An Abuser
“Mendicants, a mendicant who abuses and insults their spiritual companions, speaking ill of the noble ones, can expect these five drawbacks.
What five?
# NOTE: chinnaparipantha is apparently unique. BB has “cuts of the outlet”. But paripantha has no attested meaning as “outlet”. The PTS dict does mention this, and gives a couple of refs, but it seems to be mistaken, as neither of these in fact support the reading. Nor is that meaning found in MW: http://sanskritdictionary.com/?iencoding=iast&q=paripantha&lang=sans&action=Search But if we take the normal meaning of paripantha, how is a parajika to “cut off the obstacle”. I propose reading as a dvanda: chinno paripantho. Also note that in this passage the vā only is used for the first three items, which might suggest the last two were added.
They’re expelled, cut off, shut out; or they commit a corrupt offense; or they contract a severe illness. They die confused. And when their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
A mendicant who abuses and insults their spiritual companions, speaking ill of the noble ones, can expect these five drawbacks.”
