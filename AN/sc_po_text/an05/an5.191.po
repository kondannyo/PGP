msgstr "In the past brahmins neither bought nor sold brahmin women. They lived together because they loved each other and wanted their family line to continue. "

# NOTE: See BB’s note for the readings. I find it very strange that brahmins are said to buy and sell brahmin women: I am not aware of this being said elsewhere. I suspect it stems from a misinterpretation of Brihadarannyaka 6.4, which parallels this very closely, where a brahman is encouraged to bribe his wife for sex when need be, using the same verb kinati. It doesn’t refer to buying a wife, certainly not selling her.

# NOTE: “Love” is odd here, but it seems to me that “sampiya” is no less odd.

# NOTE: The importance of this as an ethical principle for the ancients perhaps hints at the nomadic pastoral origins of the Indo-European peoples.
