“Mendicants, a mendicant with five factors is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.
What five?
It’s when they have the entire spectrum of the master’s ethics, immersion, wisdom, freedom, and knowledge and vision of freedom.
A mendicant with these five qualities … is the supreme field of merit for the world.”
