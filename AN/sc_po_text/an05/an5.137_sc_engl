Numbered Discourses 5
14. Kings
137. Little Sleep
“Mendicants, these five sleep little at night, staying mostly awake.
What five?
A woman longing for a man.
A man longing for a woman.
A thief longing for their loot.
A king busy with his duties.
A mendicant longing for freedom from attachment.
These five sleep little at night, staying mostly awake.”
