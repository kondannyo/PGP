# NOTE: BB follows the comm in translating ayatana as base (=cause=karana). But the “ayatana” doesn’t “cause” liberation, it is an opportunity for it. The root of ayatana means an extended or stretched out space, i.e. field, region, scope. Here it refers to the “occasion” or “opportunity” within which liberation can happen. Notice how the text uses the locative yattha, tranls. by BB as instrumental “by means of which”. Sure, there’s plenty of places where that works. But here there’s no need.
