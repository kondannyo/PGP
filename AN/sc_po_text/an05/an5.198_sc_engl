“Mendicants, speech that has five factors is well spoken, not poorly spoken. It’s blameless and is not criticized by sensible people.
What five?
It is speech that is timely, true, gentle, beneficial, and loving.
Speech with these five factors is well spoken, not poorly spoken. It’s blameless and is not criticized by sensible people.”
