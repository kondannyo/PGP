# NOTE: vissaṭṭhupasevī is dubious, see the variants and BB’s note. He follows comm., but I can’t see how to get “divided” out of any of the variants. It seems to me the meaning is possibly vi+attha (for the wrong reasons) or visattha, a close friend or confidant, harking back to the first clause. Here it presumably means that a mendicant spends too much time with friends, and doesn’t treat people equally, leading on to the next clause.
