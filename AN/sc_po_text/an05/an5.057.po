# NOTE: BB renders “yobbane yobbanamado “as” in their youth … intoxicated with their youth”, and so with the subsequent sections. However this is problematic in meaning: do old people not do stupid things infatuated with youth? The same idiom occurs at AN 3.39, where BB renders “intoxicated with youth”. In other words, he reads the locative as locative of reference, lit. “with regards to youth, intoxicated with youth”, which in this case is best left implicit. I follow this approach in both cases.
