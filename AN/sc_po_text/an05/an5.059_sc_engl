59. Gone Forth When Old (1st)
“Mendicants, it’s hard to find someone gone forth when old who has five qualities.
What five?
It’s hard to find someone gone forth when old who is sophisticated, well-presented, and learned, who can teach Dhamma, and has memorized the texts on monastic training.
It’s hard to find someone gone forth when old who has these five qualities.”
