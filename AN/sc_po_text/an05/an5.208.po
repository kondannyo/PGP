# NOTE: BB uses the modern “brushing teeth”. But while toothwoods, or as more widely known, chew sticks, are somewhat obscure, they are a distinct means of cleaning the teeth. I learned how to make and use them in Thailand. And they have their own wikipedia page! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teeth_cleaning_twig Check out the study here, which shows that they are as good or better than toothbrushes: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4114011/

# NOTE: This section emphasizes why this really needs to be chew sticks. Brushing your teeth doesn’t help your vision. But one of the basic principles of holistic medicine like ayurveda is that multiple different systems are affected. Liquorice, for example, is an ayurvedic root that can be a chew stick and is a digestive, an anti-phlegmatic, treatment for food poisoning, and is said to be good for the eyes, note that it’s exactly the same term as in the Pali (Chakshushya—Good for eyes,) http://easyayurveda.com/2012/12/08/licorice-benefits-medicinal-qualities-complete-ayurveda-details/. In fact the modern ayurvedic description of benefits suggest that liquorice was in fact used. Neem, another popular chew stick, is a digestive http://www.yogamag.net/archives/2008/ajan08/neem.shtml

# NOTE: This sutta, and the next couple, give a good idea why ādīnava is best not rendered as “danger”. A “danger” is primarily a possible threat. The adinavas are not just possible, they are inherent in the thing. They’re a natural drawback or downside.
