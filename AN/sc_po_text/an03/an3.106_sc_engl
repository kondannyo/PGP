106. Ascetics and Brahmins
“Mendicants, there are ascetics and brahmins who don’t truly understand the world’s gratification, drawback, and escape for what they are.
I don’t regard them as true ascetics and brahmins. Those venerables don’t realize the goal of life as an ascetic or brahmin, and don’t live having realized it with their own insight.
