Numbered Discourses 3
1. Fools
8. Hurtful
“A fool is known by three things.
What three?
Hurtful deeds by way of body, speech, and mind. … An astute person is known by kind deeds by way of body, speech, and mind.
These are the three things by which an astute person is known.
So you should train like this:
‘We will reject the three qualities by which a fool is known, and we will undertake and follow the three qualities by which an astute person is known.’
That’s how you should train.”
