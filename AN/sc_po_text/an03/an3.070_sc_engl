Numbered Discourses 3
7. The Great Chapter
70. Sabbath
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother.
Then Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to her,
“So, Visākhā, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?”
“Today, sir, I’m observing the sabbath.”
“There are, Visākhā, these three sabbaths.
What three?
The sabbath of the cowherds, the sabbath of the Jains, and the sabbath of the noble ones.
And what is the sabbath of the cowherds?
It’s just like a cowherd who, in the late afternoon, takes the cows back to their owners. They reflect:
‘Today the cows grazed in this place and that, and they drank in this place and that.
Tomorrow the cows will graze in this place and that, and drink in this place and that.’
In the same way, someone keeping the sabbath reflects:
‘Today I ate this and that, and had a meal of this and that.
Tomorrow I’ll eat this and that, and have a meal of this and that.’
And so they spend their day with a mind full of covetousness.
That’s the sabbath of the cowherds.
When the cowherd’s sabbath is observed like this it’s not very fruitful or beneficial or splendid or bountiful.
And what is the sabbath of the Jains?
There’s a kind of ascetic belonging to a group called the Jains.
# NOTE: Rendered as plural by BB. At SN55.12 the text is also singular, but at AN 10.176 there is a variant in plural. To me the plural reads better in English.
They encourage their disciples:
‘Please, good people, don’t hurt any living creatures more than a hundred leagues away to the east.
Don’t hurt any living creatures more than a hundred leagues away to the west.
Don’t hurt any living creatures more than a hundred leagues away to the north.
Don’t hurt any living creatures more than a hundred leagues away to the south.’
So they encourage kindness and compassion for some creatures and not others.
On the sabbath, they encourage their disciples:
‘Please, good people, take off all your clothes and say:
“I don’t belong to anyone anywhere! And nothing belongs to me anywhere!”’
But their mother and father still know,
‘This is our child.’
And they know,
‘This is my mother and father.’
Partner and child still know,
‘This is our supporter.’
And they know,
‘This is my partner and child.’
Bondservants, workers, and staff still know:
‘This is our master.’
And they know,
‘These are my bondservants, workers, and staff.’
So, at a time when they should be encouraged to speak the truth, the Jains encourage them to lie.
This, I say, is lying.
When the night has passed they use their possessions once more, though they’ve not been given back to them.
This, I say, is stealing.
That’s the sabbath of the Jains.
When the Jain’s sabbath is observed like this it’s not very fruitful or beneficial or splendid or bountiful.
And what is the sabbath of the noble ones?
A corrupt mind is cleaned by applying effort.
And how is a corrupt mind cleaned by applying effort?
It’s when a noble disciple recollects the Realized One:
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’
As they recollect the Realized One, their mind becomes clear, joy arises, and mental corruptions are given up.
It’s just like cleaning a dirty head by applying effort.
And how is a dirty head cleaned by applying effort?
With cleansing paste, clay, and water, and by applying the appropriate effort.
In the same way, a corrupt mind is cleaned by applying effort.

And how is a dirty body cleaned by applying effort?
# NOTE: Cuṇṇa is churna, which in Ayurveda is usually a paste of predominately herbal composition. Sotti is Skt śūkti, i.e. pearl or oyster shell. Powdered pearl seems a little exotic as a basic bathing ingredient, so perhaps it included various kinds of powdered shells. These are also used today in Ayurveda.
With pastes of powdered shells and herbs, water, and by applying the appropriate effort.
That’s how a dirty body is cleaned by applying effort.
In the same way, a corrupt mind is cleaned by applying effort.

And how is a corrupt mind cleaned by applying effort?
It’s when a noble disciple recollects the Saṅgha:
‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, straightforward, methodical, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’
As they recollect the Saṅgha, their mind becomes clear, joy arises, and mental corruptions are given up. It’s just like cleaning a dirty cloth by applying effort.
And how is a dirty cloth cleaned by applying effort?
# NOTE: Reading ūsa, see var.
With salt, lye, cow dung, and water, and by applying the appropriate effort.

It’s when a noble disciple recollects the deities:
‘There are the Gods of the Four Great Kings, the Gods of the Thirty-Three, the Gods of Yama, the Joyful Gods, the Gods Who Love to Create, the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others, the Gods of Brahmā’s Host, and gods even higher than these.
When those deities passed away from here, they were reborn there because of their faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom. I, too, have the same kind of faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom.’




As they recollect the faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom of both themselves and those deities, their mind becomes clear, joy arises, and mental corruptions are given up. It’s just like cleaning dirty gold by applying effort.

With a furnace, flux, a blowpipe, and tongs, and by applying the appropriate effort.

That’s how a corrupt mind is cleaned by applying effort.
Then that noble disciple reflects:
‘As long as they live, the perfected ones give up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. They are scrupulous and kind, and live full of compassion for all living beings.
I, too, for this day and night will give up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. I’ll be scrupulous and kind, and live full of compassion for all living beings.
I will observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.
As long as they live, the perfected ones give up stealing. They take only what’s given, and expect only what’s given. They keep themselves clean by not thieving.
I, too, for this day and night will give up stealing. I’ll take only what’s given, and expect only what’s given. I’ll keep myself clean by not thieving.

I, too, for this day and night will give up unchastity. I will be celibate, set apart, avoiding the common practice of sex.
I will observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.

I, too, for this day and night will give up high and luxurious beds. I’ll sleep in a low place, either a cot or a straw mat.
I will observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.’
That’s the sabbath of the noble ones.
When the sabbath of the noble ones is observed like this it’s very fruitful and beneficial and splendid and bountiful.
How much so?
Suppose you were to rule as sovereign lord over these sixteen great countries—Aṅga, Magadha, Kāsī, Kosala, Vajjī, Malla, Ceti, Vaṅga, Kuru, Pañcāla, Maccha, Sūrusena, Assaka, Avanti, Gandhāra, and Kamboja—full of the seven treasures.
This wouldn’t be worth a sixteenth part of the sabbath with its eight factors.
Why is that?
Because human kingship is a poor thing compared to the happiness of the gods.
Fifty years in the human realm is one day and night for the gods of the Four Great Kings.
Thirty such days make up a month.
Twelve such months make up a year.
The life span of the gods of the Four Great Kings is five hundred of these divine years.
It’s possible that a woman or man who has observed the eight-factored sabbath will—when their body breaks up, after death—be reborn in the company of the gods of the Four Great Kings.
This is what I was referring to when I said:
‘Human kingship is a poor thing compared to the happiness of the gods.’
A hundred years in the human realm is one day and night for the Gods of the Thirty-Three.
Thirty such days make up a month.
Twelve such months make up a year.
The life span of the Gods of the Thirty-Three is a thousand of these divine years.

Sixteen hundred years in the human realm is one day and night for the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others.
Thirty such days make up a month.
Twelve such months make up a year.
The life span of the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others is sixteen thousand of these divine years.
It’s possible that a woman or man who has observed the eight-factored sabbath will—when their body breaks up, after death—be reborn in the company of the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others.
This is what I was referring to when I said:
‘Human kingship is a poor thing compared to the happiness of the gods.’
You shouldn’t kill living creatures, or steal,
or lie, or drink alcohol.
Be celibate, refraining from sex,
and don’t eat at night, the wrong time.
Not wearing garlands or applying fragrance,
you should sleep on a low bed, or a mat on the ground.
This is the eight-factored sabbath, they say,
explained by the Buddha, who has gone to suffering’s end.
The moon and sun are both fair to see,
radiating as far as they revolve.
Those shining ones in the sky light up the quarters,
dispelling the darkness as they traverse the heavens.
All of the wealth that’s found in this realm—
pearls, gems, fine beryl too,
horn-gold or mountain gold,
# NOTE: Comm says gold dug by ants, which repeats a curious fable well-known in the West from Herodotus. It seems the comms were listening to the same fables that Herodotus was. Modern research suggests that the origin of the fable is the Himalayan marmot, whose leavings are in fact sifted for gold by local tribespeople.
or natural gold dug up by marmots—
they’re not worth a sixteenth part
of the sabbath with its eight factors,
as all the constellations of stars can’t equal the light of the moon.
So an ethical woman or man,
who has observed the eight-factored sabbath,
having made merit whose outcome is happiness,
blameless, they go to a heavenly place.”
