Numbered Discourses 3
5. The Lesser Chapter
41. Present
“Mendicants, when three things are present, a faithful gentleman makes much merit.
What three?
When faith is present,
when a gift to give is present,
and when those worthy of a religious donation are present.
When these three things are present, a faithful gentleman makes much merit.”
