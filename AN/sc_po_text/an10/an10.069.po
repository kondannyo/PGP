# NOTE: Note the idiom shifts from the standard anuyutta viharati to upadayupadaya, an unusual phrase, which however is not reflected in BB’s rendering. the correct sense of the idiom is clear from MN 12, where it means to bring up questions again and again, to continuously question. See also AN 8.8.
