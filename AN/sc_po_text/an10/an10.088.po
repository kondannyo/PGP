They overestimate their good qualities, or live the spiritual life dissatisfied, or commit a corrupt offense, or contract a severe illness, or go mad and lose their mind. They feel lost when they die. And when their body breaks up, after death, they are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. "
