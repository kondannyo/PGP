# NOTE: BB: “How am I spending my nights and days”, Thanissaro: “What am I becoming as the days & nights fly past?”, Rhys Davids: “As days and nights pass quickly by, how have they found me? and how left?”, Piyadassi: “How do I spend my nights and days?” Kathambhuta only occurs twice elsewhere in the suttas, and in both cases it clearly means “what sort “of”. I think this is a reflection about a perspective on how you” re changing as life goes on, not just “did I do my meditation this morning!”
