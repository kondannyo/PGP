“For insight into greed, ten things should be developed.
What ten?
The perceptions of ugliness, death, repulsiveness of food, dissatisfaction with the whole world, impermanence, suffering in impermanence, and not-self in suffering, giving up, fading away, and cessation.
For insight into greed, these ten things should be developed.”
