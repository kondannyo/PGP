“Mendicants, these ten things when developed and cultivated are not very fruitful and beneficial apart from the Holy One’s training.
What ten?
Right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right immersion, right knowledge, and right freedom.
These are the ten things that when developed and cultivated are not very fruitful and beneficial apart from the Holy One’s training.”
