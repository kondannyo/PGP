“Mendicants, Jain ascetics have ten bad qualities.
What ten?
They’re faithless and
unethical,
without conscience
or prudence,
and devoted to bad persons.
They glorify themselves and put others down.
They’re attached to their own views, holding them tight, and refusing to let go.
They’re deceptive,
with bad desires
and bad friends.
# NOTE: Ouch.
Jain ascetics have these ten bad qualities.”
