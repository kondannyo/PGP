“Mendicants, these ten perceptions, when developed and cultivated, are very fruitful and beneficial. They culminate in the deathless and end with the deathless.
What ten?
The perceptions of impermanence, not-self, death, repulsiveness of food, dissatisfaction with the whole world, a skeleton, a worm-infested corpse, a livid corpse, a split open corpse, and a bloated corpse.
These ten perceptions, when developed and cultivated, are very fruitful and beneficial. They culminate in the deathless and end with the deathless.”
