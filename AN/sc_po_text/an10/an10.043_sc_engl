43. Roots of Arguments (2nd)
“Sir, how many roots of arguments are there?”
“Upāli, there are ten roots of arguments.
What ten?
It’s when a mendicant explains what is not an offense as an offense, and what is an offense as not an offense. They explain a light offense as a serious offense, and a serious offense as a light offense. They explain an offense committed with corrupt intention as an offense not committed with corrupt intention, and an offense not committed with corrupt intention as an offense committed with corrupt intention. They explain an offense requiring rehabilitation as an offense not requiring rehabilitation, and an offense not requiring rehabilitation as an offense requiring rehabilitation. They explain an offense with redress as an offense without redress, and an offense without redress as an offense with redress.
These are the ten roots of arguments.”
