4. With Upāli
37. Schism in the Saṅgha
“Sir, they speak of ‘schism in the Saṅgha’.
How is schism in the Saṅgha defined?”
“Upāli, it’s when a mendicant explains what is not the teaching as the teaching, and what is the teaching as not the teaching. They explain what is not the training as the training, and what is the training as not the training. They explain what was not spoken and stated by the Realized One as spoken and stated by the Realized One, and what was spoken and stated by the Realized One as not spoken and stated by the Realized One. They explain what was not practiced by the Realized One as practiced by the Realized One, and what was practiced by the Realized One as not practiced by the Realized One. They explain what was not prescribed by the Realized One as prescribed by the Realized One, and what was prescribed by the Realized One as not prescribed by the Realized One.
On these ten grounds they split off and go their own way. They perform legal acts autonomously and recite the monastic code autonomously.
That is how schism in the Saṅgha is defined.”
