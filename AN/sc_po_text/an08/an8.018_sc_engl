Numbered Discourses 8
2. The Great Chapter
18. Catching (2nd)
“Mendicants, a man catches a woman using eight features.
What eight?
With weeping,
laughing,
speaking,
appearance,
gifts of wildflowers,
scents,
tastes,
and touches.
A man catches a woman using these eight features.
But those beings who are caught by touch are well and truly caught.”
