Numbered Discourses 8
2. The Great Chapter
17. Catching (1st)
“Mendicants, a woman catches a man using eight features.
What eight?
# NOTE: See BB’s note for variations between this list and other editions. I use the MS text.
With weeping,
laughing,
speaking,
appearance,
gifts of wildflowers,
scents,
tastes,
and touches.
A woman catches a man using these eight features.
But those beings who are caught by touch are well and truly caught.”
