But this is absurd. The text is perfectly clear: the Buddha walked from Kapilavatthu to Vesali, and Mahapajapati followed him.

# NOTE: The bahukara sentence is clumsily edited; BB uses square brackets to parse it. The many different versions of the text differ here. It seems to have been pasted here and lightly edited. Compare AN 2.32, AN 3.31, AN 4.63. Ananda is quoting the Buddha’s own words back at him! In each of these cases the same bahukara phrase is used, in the same context, and each time it sanely starts a new sentence. One way this might be fixed is if sacchikatum was followed by a repeat of “sadhu, bhante …”, which subsequently became lost through abbreviation. However I can’t find any manuscript support for this. So I’ve chosen to leave the text in its broken state. Note that the BHS version o this passage at https://suttacentral.net/san-lo-bi-vb-nidana/san/roth begins the phrase with "yato" rather than "sace". Note too that at AN 2.32 apadaka and posaka are applied without distinction to mother and father, so they cannot mean “wet nurse and foster mother” as BB has it.
