Venerables, these seven cases that are settlements of legal issues come up for recitation.

@ eng-sat-main.tex
For the calming, for the stilling of whichever legal issues have arisen:\\
the removal through the presence (of the bhikkhu) is to be given,\\
the removal (of the accusation) through remembrance is to be given,\\
the removal (of the accusation) through not (being) insane is to be given,\\
he is to be made to do (the offence-procedure) through admitting (the offence),\\
the (decision of the) majority,\\
(the decision making it) worse for him,\\
(the decision) covering (the offences as if) with grass.

@ eng-sat-uddittha.tex
Recited, Venerables, have been the seven cases that are settlements of legal issues.

Concerning that I ask the Venerables: (Are you) pure in this?\\
A second time again I ask: (Are you) pure in this?\\
A third time again I ask: (Are you) pure in this?\\
The venerables are pure in this, therefore there is silence, thus I keep this (in mind).

@ eng-sat-nitthito.tex
The cases that are settlements of legal issues have finished.
