The Disciplinary Code of the Bhikkhu

Homage to the Blessed, Noble, and Perfectly Enlightened One.
(3 times)

Venerable Sir, let the Community listen to me! Today is a fifteenth (day) Observance. If it is suitable to the Community , (then) the Community should do the Observance (and) should recite the Disciplinary Code.

What is the preliminary for the Community? Venerables, announce the purity, (for) I shall recite the Disciplinary Code. Let us all (who are) present listen to it carefully (and) let us take it to mind.

Whoever may have an offence, he should disclose (it). When there is no offence, (then it) is to be silent. By the silence I shall know the Venerables (with the thought): “(They are) pure.” As an answer occurs to (a bhikkhu) who is asked individually, just so in such an assembly (as this one) there is the announcement up to the third time. But if any bhikkhu, (who is) remembering (an offence) when the announcement is being made up to the third time, should not disclose the existing offence, there is (a further offence of) deliberate false speech for him. 

Now, venerables, deliberate false speech has been called an obstructive act by the Fortunate One. Therefore, by a bhikkhu who is remembering, who has committed (an offence), who is desiring purification, an existing offence is to be disclosed; because, (after) having disclosed (it), there is comfort for him.

The recitation of the introduction is finished.

Herein these four cases involving disqualification come up for recitation.

1. If any bhikkhu (who) has entered upon the training and livelihood for bhikkhus, not having rejected the training, not having disclosed (his) incapability, should engage in the act of sexual intercourse, even with just a female animal, he is disqualified, not in communion.

2. If any bhikkhu should take (what has) not been given from a village or wilderness-area, which is reckoned as theft, (and) the taking of what has not been given (is) of the kind (that) on account of (it) kings, having caught the robber, would physically punish or imprison or banish (him, saying): “You are a robber! You are a fool! You are insane! You are a thief!,” a bhikkhu taking (what has) not been given of such a kind, is also disqualified, not in communion.

3. If any bhikkhu should deliberately deprive a human being of life, or should seek an assassin for him, or should praise the attractiveness of death, or should incite (him) to death (saying): “Dear man, what (use) is this bad, wretched life for you? Death is better than life for you!” should he, (having) such-thought-and- mind, (having such-) thought-and-intention, praise in manifold ways the beauty of death or incite (him) to death, he also is disqualified, not in communion.

4. If any bhikkhu, (though) not directly knowing (it), should claim a superhuman state pertaining to himself, (a state of) knowing and seeing (that is) suitable for the noble (ones), (saying): “Thus I know! Thus I see!,” (and) then, on another occasion, (whether) being interrogated or not being interrogated, having committed (the offence), desiring purification, should say so: “(Although) not knowing (it,) I spoke thus (saying): `I know,’ not seeing (it, I spoke, saying:) `I see.’ I bluffed vainly (and) falsely,” except (when said) in overestimation, he also is disqualified, not in communion.

Venerables, the four cases involving disqualification have been recited, a bhikkhu who has committed any one of them, does not obtain the communion with bhikkhus. As (he was) before, so (he is) after (committing it): he is one who is disqualified, not in communion.

Concerning that I ask the Venerables: (Are you) pure in this?
A second time again I ask: (Are you) pure in this?
A third time again I ask: (Are you) pure in this?
The venerables are pure in this, therefore there is silence, so do I bear this (in mind).

The recitation of the (cases involving) disqualification is finished

Venerables, these thirteen cases (concerning) the community in the beginning and in the rest (of the procedure) come up for recitation. 

1. The intentional emission of semen, except in a dream: (this is a case concerning) the community in the beginning and in the rest (of the procedure).

2. If any bhikkhu, under the influence of an altered mind, should engage in (intimate) physical contact together with a woman (such as): the holding of a hand, or holding a braid (of hair), or caressing any limb: (this is a case concerning) the community in the beginning and in the rest (of the procedure).

3. If any bhikkhu, under the influence of an altered mind, should speak suggestively with depraved words to a woman, like a young man to a young woman, (with words) concerned with sexual intercourse: (this is a case concerning) the community in the beginning and in the rest (of the procedure).

4. If any bhikkhu, under the influence of an altered mind, (and) in the presence of a woman, should speak praise about the ministering to himself with sex: “Sister, this is the best of ministerings: she who would minister to a virtuous, good natured celibate like me with this act!,” (which is something) connected with sexual intercourse: (this is a case concerning) the community in the beginning and in the rest (of the procedure).

5. If any bhikkhu should engage in mediating a man's intention to a woman, or a woman's intention to a man, for being a wife or for being a mistress, even for being one on (just) that occasion: (this is a case concerning) the community in the beginning and in the rest (of the procedure).

6. entailing harm (to creatures and which is) having a surrounding space. If a bhikkhu, having requested it himself, should have a hut built on a site entailing harm (to creatures), (and) not having a surrounding space, or if he should not bring bhikkhus to (it) for appointing the site, or if he should let (it) exceed the measure: (this is a case concerning) the community in the beginning and in the rest (of the procedure).

7. By a bhikkhu who is having a large dwelling built, which has an owner, (and) is designated for himself, bhikkhus are to be brought to (it) for appointing the site. By those bhikkhus a site not entailing harm (to any creatures) (and) having a surrounding space is to be appointed. If a bhikkhu should have a hut built on a site entailing harm (to creatures), (and) not having a surrounding space, or if he should not bring bhikkhus to (it) for appointing the site, (this is a case concerning) the community in the beginning and in the rest (of the procedure).

8. If any bhikkhu, corrupted by malice (and) upset, should accuse a bhikkhu with a groundless case involving disqualification (thinking): “If only I could make him fall away from this holy life!,” (and) then, on another occasion, (whether) being interrogated or not being interrogated, if that legal issue is really groundless, and if the bhikkhu stands firm in malice: (this is a case concerning) the community in the beginning and in the rest (of the procedure).

9. If any bhikkhu, corrupted by malice (and) upset, should accuse a bhikkhu with a case involving disqualification, having taken (it) up (with) some point, which is a mere pretext, of a legal issue belonging to another class (thinking): “If only I could make him fall away from this holy life!,” (and) then, on another occasion, (whether) being interrogated or not being interrogated, if that legal issue is really belonging to another class, (and) some point, which a mere pretext, has been taken up, and if the bhikkhu stands firm in malice: (this is a case concerning) the community in the beginning and in the rest (of the procedure).

10. If any bhikkhu should endeavor for the schism of a united community, or having undertaken, should persist in upholding a legal issue conducive to schism, (then) that bhikkhu should be spoken to thus by the bhikkhus: “Let the venerable one not endeavor for the schism of the united community, or having undertaken, persist in upholding a legal issue conducive to schism. Let the venerable one convene with the community, for a united community, which is on friendly terms, which is not disputing, which has a single recitation, dwells in comfort,” and (if) that bhikkhu being spoken to thus by the bhikkhus should persist in the same way (as before), (then) that bhikkhu is to be argued with up to three times by the bhikkhus for the relinquishing of that (course), (and if that bhikkhu,) being argued with up to three times, should relinquish that (course), then this is good, (but) if he should not relinquish (it): (this is a case concerning) the community in the beginning and in the rest (of the procedure).

11. Now, there are bhikkhus who are followers of that same bhikkhu, (and) who are speaking for (his) faction: one, or two, or three, (and) they should say so: “Venerables, don't say anything to this bhikkhu! This bhikkhu is one who speaks in accordance with the Teaching and this bhikkhu is one who speaks in accordance the Discipline; this (bhikkhu), having received (our) consent and favour defines (the Teaching & Discipline). Knowing us, he speaks, (and) this suits us too.” (Then) those bhikkhus should be spoken to thus by the bhikkhus: “Venerables, don't say so! This bhikkhu does not speak in accordance with the Teaching, and this bhikkhu does not speak in accordance with the Discipline! Don't let the venerables too favour the schism of the community. Let there be convening with the community for the venerables, for a united community, which is on friendly terms, which is not disputing, which has a single recitation, dwells in comfort,” and (if) those bhikkhus being spoken to thus by the bhikkhus should persist in the same way (as before), (then) those bhikkhus are to be argued with up to three times by the bhikkhus for the relinquishing of that (course), (and if those bhikkhus) being argued with up to three times, should relinquish that (course), then this is good, (but) if they should not relinquish (it): (this is a case concerning) the community in the beginning and in the rest (of the procedure).

12. Now, a bhikkhu is of a nature difficult to be spoken to, (and when) being righteously spoken to by the bhikkhus about the training precepts included in the recitation, he makes himself (one) who can not be spoken to (saying): “Venerables, don't say anything good or bad to me, and I too shall not say anything good or bad to the venerables! Venerables, refrain from speaking to me!” (Then) that bhikkhu should be spoken to thus by the bhikkhus: “Let the venerable one one not make himself (one) who cannot be spoken to. Let the venerable one make himself (one) who can be spoken to. Let the venerable one speak to the bhikkhus with righteousness and the monks too will speak to the venerable one with righteousness. For the Blessed One's assembly has grown thus, that is, by the speaking of one to another, by the rehabilitating of one another,” and (if) that bhikkhu being spoken to thus by the bhikkhus should persist in the same way (as before), (then) that bhikkhu is to be argued with up to three times by the bhikkhus for the relinquishing of that (course), (and if that bhikkhu,) being argued with up to three times, should relinquish that (course), then this is good, (but) if he should not relinquish (it): (this is a case concerning) the community in the beginning and in the rest (of the procedure).

13. Now, a bhikkhu lives dependent upon a certain village or town who is a spoiler of families, who is of bad behaviour. His bad behaviour is seen and is heard about, and the families spoilt by him are seen and heard about. That bhikkhu is to be spoken to thus by the bhikkhus: “The venerable one is a spoiler of families, one who is of bad behaviour. The bad behaviour of the venerable one is seen and is heard about, and the families spoilt by the venerable one are seen and are heard about. Let the venerable one depart from this dwelling-place! Enough of you dwelling here!” and (if) that bhikkhu being spoken to thus by the bhikkhus should say thus to those bhikkhus: “The bhikkhus are driven by desire; the bhikkhus are driven by anger; the bhikkhus are driven by delusion; the bhikkhus are driven by fear. They banish someone because of this kind of offence, (but) another one they do not banish.” (Then) that bhikkhu is to be spoken to thus by the bhikkhus: “Let the venerable one not speak thus! The bhikkhus are not driven by desire; and the bhikkhus are not driven by anger; and the bhikkhus are not driven by delusion; and the bhikkhus are not driven by fear. The venerable one is a spoiler of families, one who is of bad behaviour. The bad  behaviour  of  the venerable  one  is  seen and  is  heard  about,  and  the families   spoilt  by the venerable  one are seen and are heard  about.  Let  the venerable  one  depart  from  this  dwelling-place! Enough of you dwelling here!” and (if) that bhikkhu being spoken to thus by the bhikkhus should persist in the same way (as before), (then) that bhikkhu is to be argued with up to three times by the bhikkhus for the relinquishing of that (course), (and if that bhikkhu,) being argued with up to three times, should relinquish that (course), then this is good, (but) if he should not relinquish (it): (this is a case concerning) the community in the beginning and in the rest (of the procedure).

Venerables, the thirteen cases (concerning) the community in the beginning and in the rest (of the procedure) have been recited, nine (cases) are of the offence-at-once (-class), four (cases) are of the up-to-the-third (time admonition-class). A bhikkhu who has committed any one of (these offenses), has to stay on probation with no choice (in the matter) for as many days as he knowingly conceals (it). Moreover, by a bhikkhu who has stayed on the probation, a six-night state of deference to (other) bhikkhus has to be entered upon. (When) the bhikkhu (is one by whom) the deference has been performed: wherever there may be a community of bhikkhus, which is a group of twenty (or more bhikkhus), there that bhikkhu should be reinstated. If a community of bhikkhus, which is a group of twenty deficient by even one (bhikkhu), should reinstate that bhikkhu (then) that bhikkhu is not reinstated, and those monks are blameworthy. This is the proper procedure here  

Concerning that I ask the venerables: (Are you) pure in this? 
A second time again I ask: (Are you) pure in this? 
A third time again I ask: (Are you) pure in this? The venerables are pure in this, therefore there is silence, so do I bear this (in mind). 

The recitation concerning the community in the beginning and the rest (of the procedure) is finished.

Venerables, these two uncertain cases come up for recitation.

1. If any bhikkhu should sit down together with a woman, one (man) with one (woman), privately, on a concealed seat (that is) sufficiently fit for doing (it), (and then if) a female lay-follower whose words can be trusted having seen that, should speak according to one of three cases: according to disqualification, according to what concerns the community in the beginning and in the rest (of the procedure), or according to expiation, (then) the bhikkhu who is admitting the sitting down should be made to do (what is) according to one of three cases: according to disqualification, or according to what concerns the community in the beginning and in the rest (of the procedure), or according to expiation, or according to whatever that female lay-follower whose words can be trusted should say, according to that the bhikkhu is to be made to do. This is an uncertain case.

2. But even if the seat is neither concealed nor sufficiently fit for doing it, but is sufficient for speaking suggestively to a woman with depraved words: if any bhikkhu should sit down on such a seat together with a woman—one (man) with one (woman), privately—(and then if) a female lay-follower whose words can be trusted having seen that, should speak according to one of two cases: according to what concerns the community in the beginning and in the rest, or according to expiation, (then) the bhikkhu admitting the sitting down is to be made to do according to one of two cases: according to what concerns the community in the beginning and in the rest (of the procedure), or according to expiation, or according to whatever that female lay-follower whose words can be trusted should say, according to that the bhikkhu is to be made to do, this too is an uncertain case.

Venerables, the two uncertain cases have been recited.
Concerning that I ask the Venerables: (Are you) pure in this?
A second time again I ask: (Are you) pure in this? 
A third time again I ask: (Are you) pure in this?
The venerables are pure in this, therefore there is silence, thus I bear this (in mind).
The recitation of the uncertain (cases) is finished.

Venerables, these thirty cases involving expiation with forfeiture come up for recitation.

1. When the robe (-cloth) has been finished by a bhikkhu, when the kaþhina (-frame-privileges) have been withdrawn, (then) extra robe (-cloth) is to be kept for ten days at the most. For one who lets it pass beyond (the ten days), (this is a case) involving expiation with forfeiture.

2. When the robe (-cloth) has been finished by a bhikkhu, when the kaþhina (-frame-privileges) have been withdrawn, if even for a single night a bhikkhu should stay apart from the three robes, except with the authorization of bhikkhus, (this is a case) involving expiation with forfeiture.

3. When the robe (-cloth) has been finished by a bhikkhu, when the kaþhina (-frame-privileges) have been withdrawn, if out-of-season robe (-cloth) should become available to a bhikkhu, by a bhikkhu who is wishing (so, it) can be accepted; having accepted (it, it) is to be made very quickly. If (the robe-cloth) should not be (enough for) the completion (of the robe), (then) for a month at the most that robe (-cloth) can be put aside by that bhikkhu for the completion of the deficiency (of robe-cloth), when there is an expectation (that he will get more robe-cloth); if he should put (it) aside more than that, even when there is an expectation (that he will get more robe-cloth), (this is a case) involving expiation with forfeiture.

4. If any bhikkhu should have a used robe (-cloth) washed, dyed, or beaten by an unrelated bhikkhunì, (this is a case) involving expiation with forfeiture.)

5. If any bhikkhu should accept a robe (-cloth) from the hand of an unrelated bhikkhunì, except in an exchange (of robes), (this is a case) involving expiation with forfeiture.

6. If any bhikkhu should request a robe (-cloth) to an unrelated male householder or female householder, except at the (right) occasion, (this is a case) involving expiation with forfeiture. Here the occasion is this: he is a bhikkhu whose robe has been robbed or whose robe has been lost; this is the occasion here.

7. If the unrelated male householder or female householder should invite him to take (as many) robe (-cloth)s (as he likes), (then) robe (-cloths for) an upper (robe) together with an inner (robe) can be accepted at the most from that robe (-cloth) by that bhikkhu; if he should accept more from that (robe-cloth), (this is a case) involving expiation with forfeiture.

8. Now, if an robe-fund has been set up for a bhikkhu by an unrelated male householder or female householder (thinking): “Having traded this robe-fund for a robe, I shall clothe the bhikkhu named so and so with a robe,” and then if that bhikkhu, previously uninvited, having approached (the householder), should make a suggestion about the robe (-cloth) (saying}: “It would be good indeed, Sir, (if you) having traded this robe-fund for a such and such a robe, were to clothe me (with a robe),” (if the suggestion is made) out of a liking for what is fine, (this is a case) involving expiation with forfeiture.

9. Now, if separate robe-funds have been set up for a bhikkhu by both unrelated male householders or female householders (thinking): “Having traded these separate robe-funds for separate robes, we shall clothe the bhikkhu named so and so with robes,” and then if that bhikkhu, previously uninvited, having approached (the householders), should make a suggestion about the robe (saying}: “It would be good indeed, Sirs, (if you) having traded these separate robe-funds for a such and such a robe, were to clothe me 
(with a robe), (you) both being one (donor),” (if the suggestion is made) out of a liking for what is fine, (this is a case) involving expiation with forfeiture.

10. Now, if a king or a kings’ official or a brahmin or a male householder should convey by messenger a robe-fund for a bhikkhu (saying): “Having traded this robe-fund for a robe, clothe the bhikkhu named so and so with a robe,” and if that messenger, having approached that bhikkhu, should say so: “Venerable Sir, this robe-fund has been brought for the venerable one. Let the venerable one accept the robe-fund!” (then) that messenger should be spoken to thus by that bhikkhu: “Sir, we do not accept a robe-fund, but we do accept a robe at the right time (when it is) allowable.” If that messenger should say thus to that bhikkhu: 
“Is there, perhaps, someone who is the steward of the venerable one?” (then,) bhikkhus, by a bhikkhu who is in need of a robe, a steward can be appointed: a monastery attendant or a male lay-follower (saying): “Sir, this is the bhikkhus' steward.” If that messenger having instructed that steward, having approached that bhikkhu, should say so: “Venerable Sir, the steward whom the venerable one has appointed has been instructed by me. Let the venerable one approach (him) at the right time (and) he will clothe you with a robe,” (then) bhikkhus, having approached the steward, (the steward) can be prompted (and) can be reminded two or three times by the bhikkhu who is in need of a robe (saying): “Sir, I am in need of a robe.” (If through) prompting (and) reminding (him) two or three times, he should have (him) bring forth that robe, it is good. If he should not have (him) bring (it) forth, (then) four times, five times, six times at the most, (it) can be stood (for) by (a bhikkhu) who has become silent. (If through) standing silently for (it) four times, five times, six times at the most, he should have (him) bring forth that robe, it is good; if (through) making effort more than that, he should have (him) produce that robe, (this is a case) involving expiation with forfeiture. If he should not have (him) produce (it), (then) from wherever (that) the robe-fund may have been brought, there (he) himself can go, or a messenger can be sent (saying): “Sirs, that robe-fund which you conveyed for the bhikkhu does not fulfil any need of that bhikkhu. Let the sirs endeavour for (what is their) own. Let not (what is their) own get lost.” This is the proper procedure here.

The section (starting with the rule) on robes is first. 

11. If any bhikkhu should have a rug mixed with silk made, (this is a case) involving expiation with forfeiture.

12. If any bhikkhu should have a rug made of pure black sheep's wool; (this is a case) involving expiation with forfeiture.

13. By a bhikkhu who is having a new rug made, two parts of pure black sheep-wool are to be taken, (and) a third (part) of white, a fourth (part) of ruddy brown. If a bhikkhu should have a rug made, without having taken two parts of pure black sheep's hair, (and) a third (part) of white, a fourth (part) of ruddy brown, (this is a case) involving expiation with forfeiture.

14. By a bhikkhu who has had a new rug made, it is to be kept for six years (at least). If within less than six years, having given up or not having given up that rug, he should have another new rug made, except with the authorisation of bhikkhus, (this is a case) involving expiation with forfeiture.

15. By a bhikkhu who is having a sitting-rug made, a sugata-span from the border of an old rug is to be taken for making (it) stained. If a bhikkhu, without having taken a sugata-span from the border of an old rug, should have a new sitting cloth made, (this is a case) involving expiation with forfeiture.

16. Now, if sheep-wool should become available to a bhikkhu who is travelling on a main road, by a bhikkhu who is wishing (so, it) can be accepted, having accepted (it, it) can be carried with his own hand for three yojanas at the most when there is no one present who can carry it; if he should carry it more than that, even when there is no one present who can carry it, (this is a case) involving expiation with forfeiture.

17. If any bhikkhu should have sheep-wool washed, dyed, or carded by an unrelated bhikkhunì, (this is a case) involving expiation with forfeiture.

18. If any bhikkhu should take gold and silver, or should have (it) taken, or should consent to (it) being deposited (for him), (this is a case) involving expiation with forfeiture.

19. If any bhikkhu should engage in the various kinds of trading in money, (this is a case) involving expiation with forfeiture.

20. If any bhikkhu should engage in the various kinds of bartering, (this is a case) involving expiation with forfeiture.

The section on sheepwool is second.

21. An extra bowl can be kept for ten days at the most. For one who lets it pass beyond (the ten days); (this is a case) involving expiation with forfeiture.

22. If any bhikkhu should exchange a bowl with less than five mends for another new bowl, (this is a case) involving expiation with forfeiture. That bowl is to be relinquished by that bhikkhu to the assembly of bhikkhus, and whichever [bowl] is the last bowl of that assembly of bhikkhus, that [bowl] is to be bestowed on that bhikkhu [thus]: “Bhikkhu, this bowl is for you, it is to be kept until breaking.” This is the proper procedure here.

23. Now, (there are) those medicines which are permissable for sick bhikkhus, namely: ghee, butter, oil, (and) honey and molasses—having been accepted, they can be partaken of (while) being kept in store for seven days at the most. For one who lets it pass beyond (the seven days), (this is a case) involving expiation with forfeiture.

24. (Thinking:) “One month is what remains of the hot season,” (then) the robe-cloth for the rain's bathing-cloth can be sought by a bhikkhu. (Thinking:) “A half month is what remains of the hot season,” (after) having made (it, it) can be worn. If earlier than (what is reckoned as) “One month is what remains of the hot season,” he should seek robe-cloth for the rain's bathing-cloth, (and) (if) earlier than (what is reckoned as) “A half month is what remains of the hot season,” he should wear (it), (this is a case) involving expiation with forfeiture.

25. If any bhikkhu, having himself given a robe to a bhikkhu, should, being resentful (and) displeased,snatch (it) away or should have it snatched away (from the bhikkhu), (this is a case) involving expiation with forfeiture.

26. If any bhikkhu, having himself requested the thread (to be used), should have a robe-cloth woven by cloth-weavers, (this is a case) involving expiation with forfeiture.

Certainly we will also (then) present a little something to the sirs,” and if that bhikkhu, having said so, should present a little something, even just a little alms-food, (this is a case) involving expiation with forfeiture.

28. For the ten days coming up to the three-month Kattiká full moon: if extraordinary robe (-cloth) should become available to a bhikkhu, (then) after considering (it as) extraordinary (robe-cloth, it) can be accepted by a bhikkhu, having been accepted, (it) is to be put aside until the occasion of the robe-season; if he should put (it) aside for more than that, (this is a case) involving expiation with forfeiture.

29. Now, the Kattika-full-moon has been observed. (There are) those wilderness lodgings which are considered risky, which are dangerous. A bhikkhu dwelling in such kind of lodgings, who is wishing (to do so), may put aside one of the three robes inside an inhabited area. And if there may be any reason for that bhikkhu for dwelling apart from that robe, the bhikkhu can dwell apart from that robe for six days at the most; if he should dwell apart for more than that, except with the authorisation of bhikkhus, (this is a case) involving expiation with forfeiture.

30. If any bhikkhu should knowingly allocate for himself a gain belonging to (and) allocated to the  community, (this is a case) involving expiation with forfeiture.

Venerables, the thirty cases involving expiation with forfeiture have been recited.
Concerning this I ask the Venerables: (Are you) pure in this?
A second time again I ask: (Are you) pure in this? 
A third time again I ask: (Are you) pure in this?
The Venerables are pure in this, therefore there is silence, thus I keep this (in mind).

The cases involving expiation with forfeiture are finished.

Venerables, these thirty cases involving expiation with forfeiture come up for recitation.
